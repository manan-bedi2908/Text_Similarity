Video from that day shows people beating pots and pans near of a line of protesters and security forces, before gun shots ring out and the crowd scatters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the melee, Zin Ko Ko Zaw was shot in the head. His brother carried him to a waiting ambulance but it was too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had to drag his body out and passed away in my hands,\" the brother, Than Zaw Oo said. Blood was pouring from his mouth and head.\\r\\n\\r\\nZin Ko Ko Zaw would have turned 23 next month. His parents say he was the breadwinner of the family, working in the local market. They were all at the protest together, but were separated when the shooting started.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are risking our lives to claim victory. They don\\'t have any weapons, but they are fully armed. All we can do is protest. They are shooting us with live bullets, please help us,\" his mother, Daw Htar said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA demonstrator shows a bullet cartridges to the camera during a protest against the military coup in Mandalay, Myanmar on March 3, 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN reached out to the ruling military regime via email but has not yet received a response. The military junta previously claimed to be showing restraint towards what it termed \"anarchic mobs.\" The state-run Global New Light Of Myanmar said \"severe action will be inevitably taken\" against \"riotous protesters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, the Myanmar Police Force said in the Global New Light, that \"rioters armed with two weapons believed to be smoke grenades\" were found to be part of protests on Wednesday. \"The protesters were no longer in the normal stage of the protest but were armed with explosive devices and resorted to violence,\" the report said, without providing further evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of people from all sections of Myanmar society have joined the protests and ongoing civil disobedience movements aiming to destabilize the new military regime. The largely leaderless movement, however, is spearheaded by young people who have come of age in the years since the military relinquished a half century of direct rule in 2011, allowing for elections and greater democratic reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now feel as if their future has been taken away.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonning masks and flimsy plastic helmets, young people are overwhelmingly at the front lines of the protests, building barricades and staring down security forces. They have suffered heavy casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivist group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has identified 48 people who have died because of the violent crackdown on protesters. Of those, half were under the age of 25, with 17 people under 20 years old. The youngest was just 14, the group reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile on Thursday, the UN Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF) said at least five children -- all boys between the ages of 14 and 17 -- as well as multiple young people and adults had been killed, and at least four children severely wounded. The group condemned \"in the strongest possible terms the use of force against children, including the use of live ammunition, and the arbitrary detention of children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our children\\'s legs are broken, heads have been injured, they are shot in their chest. We cannot take this anymore, they are intentionally targeting the young people with bright futures,\" said Zin Ko Ko Zaw\\'s distraught mother Daw Htar.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Quinley, Senior Human Rights Specialist at Fortify Rights said many of those out protesting are young people in their 20s and 30s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the next generation of Myanmar that want the country to be led and governed democratically. And they want their leaders to uphold human rights principles,\" said Quinley. \"And these are the people that are dying in the streets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the youngest killed is 16-year-old Nay Myo Aung. He was protesting with his cousin in Mandalay on Wednesday when police and military dispersed the crowd using tear gas. As demonstrators began to build barricades, police then began firing rubber bullets, as well as live ammunition, his cousin said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got shot with two rubber bullets and so I fell down, and then my cousin tried to lift me up and that\\'s when he got shot with a real bullet,\" said Hein Htet Aung, 17. He added the protesters had been shouting insults at the security forces, but otherwise were peaceful that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nNay Myo Aung was rushed to hospital but died a few hours later from his injuries. The bullet shot through his left arm and pierced his lung, doctors told the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis brother Ko Ko Lin Maung, 21, said he was a \"good boy\" who looked after their grandmother following the death of their parents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He died for the country, so that\\'s one thing we can be proud of but I only have this one little brother so I feel very sad about it,\" Ko Ko Lin Maung said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople pay respects as the hearse carrying the coffin of Ma Kyal Sin drives on the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother victim of Wednesday\\'s bloodshed was Ma Kyal Sin, known by the name Angel. Wearing a T-shirt that read \"Everything will be OK,\" Angel had regularly joined protests fighting for democracy, according to her friends interviewed by Reuters. She was shot in the head by security forces during an anti-coup protest that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore she went out protesting, the dancer and taekwondo champion had posted on social media details of her blood group, contact number and a request to donate her body in the event of her death, Reuters said.\\r\\n\\r\\nVideo of her final moments showed her crouching on the street with other protesters, rallying the crowd in Mandalay before tear gas is thrown. The bullets followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer funeral on Thursday drew hundreds of mourners, with throngs of people lining the route of the procession in Mandalay, holding up the three finger salute from the Hunger Games movies, which has been adopted by protesters as a symbol of resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was a happy girl, she loved her family and her father loved her so much too,\" her friend Myat Thu told Reuters. \"We are not in a war. There is no reason to use live bullets on people. If they are human, they will not do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Myanmar Police Force issued a statement Friday in the Global New Light saying they are looking into Ma Kyal Sin\\'s death. The report said police analyzed a photo of the injury of the young woman and concluded \"it was not an injury caused by a riot weapon.\" The statement continued, if her injury had been caused by either a \"riot weapon or live ammunition\" it would not be possible \"for head of the deceased person to be in good condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRights groups have said the level of coordination and use of force used by the military junta in recent protests indicates they are no longer intending to merely disperse protesters as a form of crowd control.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople stand next to Ma Kyal Sin\\'s coffin during her funeral ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The similar use of excessive and lethal force by security forces in towns and cities throughout the country demonstrates coordination between units and an overarching national strategy,\" rights group Fortify Rights said Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This isn\\'t a non lethal tactic to disperse protesters. This is an attack on peaceful protesters throughout the country,\" said Quinley. \"And these are not crowd control techniques, this is an attack on civilians and people protesting against the military takeover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said \"we\\'re seeing orders that police and military soldiers shoot people down in cold blood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'re using 12-guage shotguns, they\\'re using 38 mm rifles they\\'re using semi-automatic rifles against peaceful protestors that pose no threat to them,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the dangers, protesters continue to go back to the streets. On Friday, police opened fire on demonstrators in Mandalay killing one young man, according to Reuters, citing witnesses.

       " 'Shanghai residents passing through the city\\'s eastern Huangpu district in October might have stumbled upon an unusual sight: a \"walking\" building.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 85-year-old primary school has been lifted off the ground -- in its entirety -- and relocated using new technology dubbed the \"walking machine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the city\\'s latest effort to preserve historic structures, engineers attached nearly 200 mobile supports under the five-story building, according to Lan Wuji, chief technical supervisor of the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supports act like robotic legs. They\\'re split into two groups which alternately rise up and down, imitating the human stride. Attached sensors help control how the building moves forward, said Lan, whose company Shanghai Evolution Shift developed the new technology in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s like giving the building crutches so it can stand up and then walk,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA timelapse shot by the company shows the school inching laboriously along, one tiny step at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a statement from the Huangpu district government, the Lagena Primary School was constructed in 1935 by the municipal board of Shanghai\\'s former French Concession. It was moved in order to make space for a new commercial and office complex, which will be completed by 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers had to first dig around the building to install the 198 mobile supports in the spaces underneath, Lan explained. After the pillars of the building were truncated, the robotic \"legs\" were then extended upward, lifting the building before moving forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of 18 days, the building was rotated 21 degrees and moved 62 meters (203 feet) away to its new location. The relocation was completed on October 15, with the old school building set to become a center for heritage protection and cultural education.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project marks the first time this \"walking machine\" method has been used in Shanghai to relocate a historical building, the government statement said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecades of destruction\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent decades, China\\'s rapid modernization has seen many historic buildings razed to clear land for gleaming skyscrapers and office buildings. But there has been growing concern about the architectural heritage lost as a result of demolition across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome cities have launched new preservation and conservation campaigns including, on occasion, the use of advanced technologies that allow old buildings to be relocated rather than demolished.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial indifference toward historic architecture can be traced back to the rule of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong. During the disastrous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, innumerable historic buildings and monuments were destroyed as part of his war on the \"Four Olds\" (old customs, culture, habits and ideas).\\r\\n\\r\\nMao\\'s death in 1976 saw calls for architectural conservation reemerge, with China\\'s government granting protected status to a number of structures before passing a heritage preservation law in the 1980s. In the years that followed, buildings, neighborhoods and even entire towns were given state support to maintain their historic appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, relentless urbanization has continued to pose a significant threat to architectural heritage. The sale of land is also a key source of revenue for local governments, meaning that buildings with architectural value are often sold off to property developers for whom conservation is not a priority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the capital Beijing, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of its historic alleys and traditional courtyard homes were destroyed between 1990 and 2010, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 2000s, cities including Nanjing and Beijing -- prompted by critics protesting the loss of old neighborhoods -- drew up long-term plans to preserve what was left of their historic sites, with protections introduced to safeguard buildings and restrict developers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese conservation efforts have taken different forms. In Beijing, a near-ruined temple was transformed into a restaurant and gallery, while in Nanjing, a cinema from the 1930s was restored to resemble its original form, with some additions outfitting it for modern use. In 2019, Shanghai welcomed Tank Shanghai, an arts center built in renovated oil tanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Relocation is not the first choice, but better than demolition,\" said Lan, the Shanghai primary school\\'s project supervisor. \"I\\'d rather not touch the historical buildings at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe added that to relocate a monument, companies and developers have to go through strict regulations, such as getting approval from government at various levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding relocations he said however, are \"a viable option.\" \"The central government is putting more emphasis on the protection of historical buildings. I\\'m happy to see that progress in recent years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving monuments\\r\\n\\r\\nShanghai has arguably been China\\'s most progressive city when it comes to heritage preservation. The survival of a number of 1930s buildings in the famous Bund district and 19th-century \"shikumen\" (or \"stone gate\") houses in the renovated Xintiandi neighborhood have offered examples of how to give old buildings new life, despite some criticism about how the redevelopments were carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city also has a track record of relocating old buildings. In 2003, the Shanghai Concert Hall, built in 1930, was moved over 66 metes (217 feet) to make way for an elevated highway. The Zhengguanghe Building -- a six-story warehouse, also from the 1930s -- was then shifted 125 feet (38 meters) as part of a local redevelopment in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few ways to go about moving a building: It can slide down a set of rails, or be pulled along by vehicles, for instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Lagena Primary School, which weighs 7,600 tons, posed a new challenge -- it\\'s T-shaped, whereas previously relocated structures were square or rectangular, according to Xinhua . The irregular shape meant that traditional methods of pulling or sliding may not have worked because it may not have withstood the lateral forces placed on it, said Lan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aerial shot of the Shanghai Lagena Primary School building. Credit: Shanghai Evolution Shift Project\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building also needed to be rotated and follow a curved route to its relocation instead of just moving in a straight line -- another challenge that required a new method.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During my 23 years of working in this area, I haven\\'t seen any other company that can move structures in a curve,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts and technicians met to discuss possibilities and test a number of different technologies before deciding on the \"walking machine,\" Xinhua said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLan told CNN he couldn\\'t share the exact cost of the project, and that relocation costs will differ case by case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It can\\'t be used as a reference, because we have to preserve the historical building no matter what,\" he said. \"But in general, it\\'s cheaper than demolishing and then rebuilding something in a new location.\"',\n",

The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn\\'t restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company released a video of its minivan â\\x80\\x94 the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica â\\x80\\x94 navigating on its own through the city\\'s downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutoX demonstrating its driverless robotaxis on the roads in Shenzhen. Credit: AutoX\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a dream,\" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. \"After working so hard for so many years, we\\'ve finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nXiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. \"We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,\" he said. \"The AI software is better [now.]\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From a technical point of view, the car is ready,\" Xiao said. \"It\\'s very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called \"Professor X.\" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won\\'t change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nRace of the robotaxi\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it\\'s not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October, Alphabet\\'s Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it\\'s like to ride in a self-driving car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June, Didi, China\\'s biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaidu BIDU Recently, Chinese tech giantalso announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba\\'s Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe startup\\'s latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the company\\'s lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,\" he added. \"For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChina, home to the world\\'s biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bar is incredibly high,\" he said. \"It\\'s extremely challenging, but we\\'re very happy.\"',\n",

Staying home is the best way to stem transmission. Below is information on what to know if you still plan to travel, last updated on March 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n(CNN) â\\x80\\x94 If you\\'re planning to travel to Japan, here\\'s what you\\'ll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basics\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan was lauded for containing the virus during the first wave but has seen a surge in cases, with a major spike in November and December.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of March 4, Japan has reported 434,944 cases of the virus and 8,068 deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour prefectures -- Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba -- are under emergency declarations as of early March, down from eleven in February.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrime Minister Suga announced on February 9 that all foreign nationals would be barred from entering the country, but did not specify a start date or give details about how this would be implemented. While the Tokyo Olympics are still scheduled to take place in 2021, Reuters reports that it is highly likely that foreign residents would be barred from attending or being in the audience. The IOC and Japanese government will make an official announcement on the matter in early March.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s on offer\\r\\n\\r\\nA heady mix of the cutting edge and deeply traditional, Japan remains a major draw for travelers from all over the globe. Whether participating in a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, scouring Tokyo\\'s Akihabara district for tech bargains or soaking in a hot onsen in the forests of Tohoku, this is a country that leaves its mark on all who visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho can go\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan has some of the most stringent travel restrictions in the world, with 152 countries on its prohibited list. Visitors from Australia, Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam may enter the country, although those traveling from China and South Korea can only arrive into the country via Tokyo Narita airport. Additionally, those traveling for study, work or to join family (subject to visa requirements) may enter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrime Minister Suga announced on January 14 that the borders would close to all foreign nationals, although there were no specifics on beginning and ending dates. He also did not specify whether this would apply to foreign citizens with Japanese residency.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the restrictions?\\r\\n\\r\\nTravelers from permitted destinations must undertake a 14-day quarantine, although it is possible to request a PCR test on arrival. A negative result allows you to finish quarantine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose traveling under Japan\\'s revised business travel rules will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure, signed and stamped by the laboratory where it was taken. While they will not need to self-isolate, they will need to provide details of their movements for the following two weeks and not use public transport.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s the Covid situation?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter low infection rates in the first wave, Japan has seen a sharp increase in cases. The Japanese government\\'s \\'Go To Travel\\' scheme, which subsidized domestic tourism in a bid to boost the economy, has been blamed by some for the rise in positive infections.\\r\\n\\r\\nTokyo has been particularly hard hit. The capital recorded 2,447 cases on January 7, the single highest per-day number since the start of the pandemic. Since then, the daily infection rate has remained in the four figures daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huge question of whether the Olympics will go on as intended remains unanswered. Japan is determined to host the events despite the ongoing virus situation. Several options have been floated, including having all athletes inside a \"bubble\" and not permitting any spectators to attend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vaccine rollout has been slow but began in late February 2021 with elderly citizens in line for the first shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can visitors expect?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile much of Japan remains open for business, cities are far quieter than usual and the government has the right to request the closure of businesses in areas of high transmission. Masks must be worn in public.\\r\\n\\r\\nUseful links',\n",

Can they play cards with their vaccinated friends? Can they host a small indoor dinner party, but should they forget to invite Uncle Frank who has been unmasked at the bar a lot?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I try to answer as many of those questions as I possibly can, because these are very thoughtful people,\" Schaffner said. \"These are the people who are trying to do the best in these circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor others who don\\'t happen to have a favorite infectious disease expert on speed dial, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention will soon publish guidelines for the fully vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 82 million vaccine doses have been given out in the US, and after a year of takeout and Zoom-only visits with mom, the vaccinated want direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think people need practical advice about how to go about their everyday lives,\" said Julia Marcus , an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard. \"I think without guidance, people may make decisions that are not informed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial: Nothing \\'nefarious\\' about delayed guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Biden administration has been saying it\\'s been working on these guidelines for weeks. They were widely expected to come out Thursday, but they\\'re still in the works, according to an official involved in the drafting process.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Trump administration, White House officials sometimes had a heavy hand with CDC guidelines, dictating what the agency could and could not say, according to CDC officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is not what is currently happening with these new guidelines, according to the Biden administration official.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think anything nefarious is going on,\" said the official.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official said a draft of the new guidelines likely has been sent to the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services so staff there could be aware ahead of time of what they said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t envy the writers of those guidelines,\" Schaffner said. \"You can paint some pictures with a fairly broad brush, but people want to apply general guidelines to specific life, and that gets very, very nitty gritty. There\\'s no way to capture everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccines offer really good protection for the vaccinated, research shows, and there\\'s good evidence they help prevent the spread of Covid-19, but the vaccines are not total \"armor,\" Schaffner said. People still need to make informed decisions about risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CDC needs to strike a tricky balance with these guidelines, the experts said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuidelines need to encourage people to get vaccinated, help the vaccinated understand that they still need to be careful, and manage the expectations of the unvaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We don\\'t want people who are not fully vaccinated to think that that everything has been lifted and already we can put things behind us, and the pandemic is over, because it\\'s not,\" the official said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were more than 64,000 newly diagnosed cases of Covid-19 in the US just on Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not like going back to 2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the guidelines will not give the vaccinated permission to start living like it\\'s 2019 again, according to a Biden administration official, the guidelines do offer some hope that the end of total social isolation is near.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, you will finally be able to show your vaccinated friends all your home DIY projects from the past year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CDC confirmed that a Politico article accurately characterized the guidelines as recommending that the vaccinated can have social interactions at small home gatherings with other fully vaccinated people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that\\'s certainly a very reasonable first step,\" said Dr. Aaron Richterman , an infectious disease physician at the University of Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t however, throw away that cloth mask yet. The guidelines will advise the vaccinated to continue to wear masks in public and keep a good physical distance from others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While we\\'re still vaccinating everyone, our primary societal goal remains to protect the unvaccinated,\" Richterman said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMasks help do just that. And there\\'s no guarantee that vaccinated people may not still carry virus in their noses or throats -- virus that may not make the carrier sick, but that could be spewed out and infect someone yet unvaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Masks continue to work, and we need them against the variants,\" Schaffner said. Public health experts worry that the spread of the more contagious variants could prolong the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guidelines should also help the vaccinated navigate interactions with loved ones at their nursing homes who have been kept behind locked doors for more than a year. They should also include travel advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, vaccination is not a \"free pass to travel,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said at a CNN Global Town Hall in early February.

       " '(CNN) Nearly a year ago, Brian Wolin got involved because he wanted to help.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, reports from inside hospitals were that health care workers were reusing N95s for days at a time. These masks are typically for one use.\\r\\n\\r\\nA chiropractor for 22 years, Wolin partnered with his brother-in-law to form Protective Health Gear, a New Jersey company set on making N95 masks to help health care workers in the coronavirus pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolin never expected to have a surplus of N95s sitting in his warehouse, waiting for buyers in an ongoing pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe\\'s not alone. CNN found several small American N95 manufacturers are struggling to bridge the disconnect between N95 supply and demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnexpected demand\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past year, nothing has been in as short a supply and as high demand as the N95 respirator mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nN95 masks are considered the gold standard in personal protective equipment because they block 95% of aerosols that may contain viruses like coronavirus. That level of protection was essential to frontline workers responding in high-risk transmission environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the pandemic hit, the US Food and Drug Administration eased rules on standards for N95 respirators, and said frontline health care workers could use products approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\\r\\n\\r\\nThat regulatory change and calls from government officials to help inspired Brian Wolin to be one of those applicants. After months of thorough paperwork and rigorous testing of his N95 mask, his company Protective Health Gear was approved in August to make N95 masks that could go straight to health care workers in need.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolin hasn\\'t seen the frantic demand he expected or has seen in news reports. Demand for his N95 mask has been so low that his company, Protective Health Gear, is only making half of its full capacity of 100,000 masks a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought the demand would be so overwhelming from everyone that we wouldn\\'t be able to even come close to providing what we needed,\" Wolin told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an interview. \"We were very surprised to not have that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDemand has been so low that Protective Health Gear actually finds itself with a surplus of critically needed N95 masks piling up in its New Jersey warehouse -- boxes and boxes of N95 masks just waiting for buyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolin has found it surprisingly difficult to connect with health care and government buyers to sell his NIOSH-approved N95 mask. He\\'s reached out to health care organizations, government agencies and has even met with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Congressman Bill Pascrell, but nothing has come from those meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We listened to your calls for help. And we\\'re here to help. So please help us help you. And as I said, we\\'re ready to open any way possible that we can to produce as many that would possibly be needed,\" Wolin told them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still high demand for N95 masks across the country. At least 62% of health care facilities needed N95 masks last month according to Get Us PPE, a national organization working to get PPE to frontline workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional N95s are still critically needed even with the CDC\\'s authorization that the masks â\\x80\\x94 which are typically single-use â\\x80\\x94 can be reused. The CDC issued the guidance at the height of the pandemic when supplies were threatened. But CNN has learned that if the policy was reversed today, there would not be enough N95s to be used on a single-use basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroken supply chain\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a Biden administration official, an estimated 22 domestic N95 manufacturers have been granted NIOSH approval during the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN spoke with seven of these new manufacturers. Six of the seven said they were having trouble connecting with health care and government buyers and actually had surpluses of N95 masks in their warehouses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official told CNN that domestic manufacturers are producing around 220 million N95 masks per month. Around 40 million are from new manufacturers per month.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll seven companies CNN spoke to said they were not operating at their maximum capacity to make the most N95 masks possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdministration officials noted the challenge in connecting these smaller manufacturers with buyers because a lot of the major hospital providers prefer to go through their existing contracts. Many of the small manufacturers didn\\'t have sales or distribution relationships as more established N95 manufacturers, so they\\'ve had a difficult time entering the market.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral smaller N95 manufacturing companies also noted that their limited production ability disincentivizes hospital and government buyers that need to fill massive orders. Some companies may also be less inclined to order from a new company because they have already invested in having a certain mask product fit-tested to their employees â\\x80\\x94 a time-consuming process that ensures optimal fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos Angeles-based N95 manufacturer Aidway Personal Care Product told CNN that since getting approved in October, they\\'ve registered with every government agency, state and government contract websites. Their employees even knocked on doors of hospitals, clinics and health care facilities to try and get their product to the community, with little success. Aidway has donated most of its product to date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have personally made phone calls and sent emails to people in our district or outside and in all of the municipalities around us in Los Angeles when, when it was the worst just a few weeks ago when ICU was at full capacity,\" Aidway Client Relationship Director Aram Arutyunyan told CNN. \"This is the most crucial time, and we were still unable to get through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAidway has about 100,000 masks sitting in storage and the raw material to build 2 million more.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemand has been so. Low the company has scaled down production and decided to focus on getting inventory to retail consumers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there\\'s a roadblock there, too. Platforms such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have restricted sales of N95s to preserve inventory for health care workers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By restricting our items from being sold, you\\'re basically in, in other words, pushing overseas products,\" Arutyunyan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Amazon spokesperson told CNN in an email: \"We currently offer a significant number of N95 masks to consumers and will continue making more available, while also ensuring we have supply available for health care workers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSenior White House staff have reached out to Amazon about the sale of domestically made N95 masks on its website, administration officials and an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last two weeks alone, we onboarded multiple domestic, certified N95 mask manufacturers to increase selection for our customers. We continue to work with additional domestic manufacturers as their N95 masks receive NIOSH certification,\" the Amazon spokesperson told CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Biden administration has reached out to at least 10 of the smaller and newer N95 manufacturers recently, an administration official told CNN this week.\\r\\n\\r\\nContracts with the federal government and these smaller companies also \"are in the realm of possibility,\" an administration official said, who cited ongoing conversations with a few of the companies. \"There are opportunities and there will be more coming,\" the official added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALG-Health in Ohio told CNN that a White House official did make an introduction to an Ohio-based health care company. But the Ohio company hasn\\'t responded, vice president of sales and marketing Brian Feeney told CNN Thursday via email.\\r\\n\\r\\nCDC guidance on masks\\r\\n\\r\\nWith more transmissible coronavirus variants emerging, some scientists and health officials have called for the Biden administration and the CDC to recommend higher quality masks to protect the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nCDC guidance remains that it \"does not recommend the use of N95 respirators for protection against COVID-19 in non-health care settings because N95 respirators should be reserved for health care workers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a letter last month experts and former Biden coronavirus advisers pushed the White House to more widely recommend use of N95 masks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrigham and Women\\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School\\'s Dr. Abraar Karan, who has been advocating for public use of N95 masks, told CNN\\'s Gupta in an interview why N95s are critical at this stage of the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nGet CNN Health\\'s weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If for four weeks the country essentially wore these masks in those risky settings like that indoors, what kind of difference do you think it would make?\" Gupta asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This would stop the epidemic,\" Karan responded.',\n",
       " '(CNN) The pace of Covid-19 vaccine administration in the US continues to improve, each day bringing the country closer to herd immunity -- the point at which enough people are protected against a disease that it cannot spread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis week, President Joe Biden said that the US will have enough vaccine for every adult by the end of May, and a CNN analysis of federal data shows that herd immunity is likely not far behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the current pace of about 2 million shots per day -- the latest seven-day average of doses administered reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the US could reach herd immunity by summer through vaccinations alone. It will likely be even sooner, if factoring in individuals who may have some natural immunity due to prior infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerd immunity thresholds for Covid-19 are only estimates at this point. But experts generally agree that somewhere between 70% and 85% of the population must be protected to suppress the spread, a range that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has recently cited.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 8% of the population -- nearly 28 million people -- is already fully vaccinated, according to the latest data from the CDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead More',\n",

       " 'It\\'s an idea that intrigues German-born photographer Corinna Kern , who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don\\'t own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master\\'s degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled \"A Place Called Home,\" in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that\\'s both transient and close-knit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe,\" she said. \"The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern\\r\\n\\r\\nWith housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it\\'s not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living,\" she writes in the text accompanying her images.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squatters\\' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters\\' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut since it\\'s now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London\\'s disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern\\'s photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He\\'s hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther images show \"The Castle,\" a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother of Kern\\'s photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. \"The use of natural light adds to a candid feel,\" she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from encountering resistance as she ventured into people\\'s intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people\\'s trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom her images and her words, it\\'s clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views,\" she writes. \"You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary.\"',\n",

They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,\" ten Hoopen said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotographer Pieter ten Hoopen\\r\\n\\r\\nThe studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed.

I tried to say as little as possible,\" he said. \"I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I always try to put some extra thought to (projects).

Then you take them out, it\\'s a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That\\'s why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way.

As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,\" he said. \"It\\'s a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t hard,\" he said. \"I just told them to relax and have fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don\\'t blame them.

       " 'Hoi An, Vietnam (CNN) New Yorker Neal Bermas had traveled around the world, but Vietnam literally stopped him in his tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money,\" Bermas said. \"It stayed with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam\\'s booming culinary and hospitality industries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,\" Bermas said. \"We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSTREETS\\' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities,\" Bermas said. \"Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, \\'maybe my kid, too.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group\\'s full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Neal Bermas: \\'Oodles of Noodles\\' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Neal Bermas: \\'Oodles of Noodles\\' 02:39\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It works. And that\\'s a push to do more to reach more young people,\" he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN\\'s Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?\\r\\n\\r\\nBermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they\\'re from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It\\'s a great resource to a young person\\'s development in our program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn\\'t discount a young person\\'s future because of their past, no matter how dire it\\'s been.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN: You\\'ve created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?\\r\\n\\r\\nBermas: There\\'s a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they\\'re becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?\\r\\n\\r\\nBermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I\\'ve made in my adult life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work at STREETS is never easy, but it\\'s important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN: You\\'ve kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?\\r\\n\\r\\nBermas: It\\'s traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day we opened the restaurant -- we\\'d been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, \"Congratulations\" and \"Welcome.\" And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing.

       " 'Cochabamba, Bolivia (CNN) Brisa De Angulo grew up in Bolivia and remembers having a wonderful childhood. That is, until she was 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s when she suffered repeated sexual abuse by an adult in her extended family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis threats to hurt other family members silenced her. She fell into a deep depression, dropped out of school and developed an eating disorder. She made multiple suicide attempts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she finally gained the courage to tell her parents about the abuse, they reported it to the police and took the case to court. But they had trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. Members of her community worked to silence her. Her home was set on fire twice, and people tried to run her down with their cars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a lot of pressure for me to stay silent, but I just couldn\\'t stay silent,\" said De Angulo, now 30. \"I found out that I wasn\\'t alone, that there were tons of girls that were also being sexually abused, and I had to do something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 12 countries that make up South America, Bolivia has the highest rates of sexual violence against women -- with seven in 10 women experiencing it in their lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, at 17 years old, De Angulo established FundaciÃ³n Una Brisa de Esperanza -- or A Breeze of Hope Foundation . At its center in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the group provides free and comprehensive psychological, legal, medical and social services for child and adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We work with the families...to see (the) child as a very powerful survivor, and to have the support that she needs so that she can take her case to court, and she can heal,\" De Angulo said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization also advocates for legal reforms and policy changes for the rights of abuse survivors in Bolivia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had to use the rest of my life to prevent other girls from going through what I went through,\" said De Angulo, whose extensive team has assisted about 1,500 young survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN spoke with De Angulo about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN: Sexual violence has long been prevalent in Bolivia. What are the cultural stereotypes you\\'re working to combat?\\r\\n\\r\\nBrisa De Angulo: We see it a lot in Bolivia, that a woman is seen as having less value than men, and that starts even before the baby is born. If it\\'s a boy, then you\\'re in this culture of being more aggressive, the one who has control. If you\\'re a girl, then you\\'re this one who has to be submissive, not make problems and sit quietly. Even from a very young age, their path is already set.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to start changing that mentality so that they can be born in a context where they will be seen as equal. One of our most powerful ways of challenging the machismo culture is to work with pregnant women, to work with that family, to start challenging the stereotypical roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also work a lot with prevention by giving workshops, training people -- people from government, police officers, judges, prosecutors, children in school.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN: Your experiences inspired you to pursue your law degree. What impact has your organization\\'s legal efforts had?\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Angulo: When I went to the authorities, I was blamed for what happened to me, I was questioned for many hours. I was told that I was insensitive for wanting to put a man in jail, for wanting to destroy my family. I was one of the first adolescents in Bolivia to take my case to court, but the judges didn\\'t want to take my case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we started the program, the conviction rate for sexual crimes was .02 percent. From the hundreds of cases that we\\'ve taken to court, we have a 95 percent conviction rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was taking my case to court, at the time, it was normal for an aggressor to question the victim on trial. It wasn\\'t a lawyer, it wasn\\'t the judge; it was the aggressor. Through our work, we\\'ve proved that that is a human rights violation and have changed the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother law is that if the aggressor married the victim, you couldn\\'t take the aggressor to court for rape. That was being used to marry a 13-year-old with a 40-year-old just to make sure that this man will never be taken to court for rape crimes. Thanks to all our work and our push to the government, we have been able to overturn this law.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN: The country now has an annual Walk Against Sexual Violence. How did that come about?\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Angulo: August 9 was one of the hardest days of my life because it was the day I had to go to court and face my aggressor. I started telling my story and asking people if they would join me on a walk against sexual violence and use a blue ribbon, meaning that you were against sexual violence.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The first year) I thought there were only going to be about 20 people who would join me. But that day, thousands of people showed up with a blue ribbon. August 9 was later declared the National Day Against Sexual Violence in Bolivia. Now thousands of people all around the country, in the most remote communities, march on August 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s beautiful because sometimes you are walking in the street and you see someone with a blue ribbon and you just look at their eyes and you know that we\\'re in this together.

But not just any job. Kieu was first examined by a doctor, who issued her a \"certificate of virginity.\" She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, the Freedom Project went to Cambodia with Oscar-winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking, Mira Sorvino . The result was \"Every Day in Cambodia: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary,\" which looked at child sex trafficking in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.\\r\\n\\r\\nKieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of \"maybe more than 50\" who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal : \"The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house -- their primary income source.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beforehand, Kieu said, \\'I did not know what the job was and whether it was good for me. I had no idea what to expect. But now I know the job was not good for me.\\' After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt \\'very heartbroken.\\' Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, \\'They held me like I was in prison.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer story is all too common in Svay Pak; she was just one of the girls whose stories were told in the film. Fast forward to 2015 and \"Everyday in Cambodia\" was named \"outstanding documentary\" by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation , winning a Gracie Allen award.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking,\" she says. \"It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAIM also now works with an \"incorruptible\" police SWAT team to raid brothels where children are working.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Sorvino adds that it\\'s not just about helping the victims. \"The demand side really needs to be addressed,\" she says. \"If people weren\\'t trying to buy child sex it wouldn\\'t be being sold.\"',\n",

       " '(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes\\' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the abuse didn\\'t stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes\\' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That\\'s when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuatamala\\'s past still haunts\\r\\n\\r\\nCifuentes\\' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it\\'s hardly unusual.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany women in Guatemala\\'s patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country\\'s 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nExplosion in violence\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country\\'s weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevailing culture of machismo\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country\\'s deeply rooted patriarchal society.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to MarÃ\\xada Machicado TerÃ¡n, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, \"80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed.\" This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Politicians don\\'t think women are important,\" says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. \"Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don\\'t go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuiroa says \"They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSigns of progress\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nCifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or \"The Powerful,\" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or \"The Powerful\" share their stories and help other women get support.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it\\'s having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia TÃ©llez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala\\'s most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or \"Opening Opportunities\". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. \"They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general\\'s office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.\\r\\n\\r\\nPehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala\\'s history of gender-based violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, \"We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.\\r\\n\\r\\nCifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it\\'s a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.',\n",
       " 'New York (CNN) Kayla Mueller, Peter Kassig, Alan Henning, David Haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by ISIS in the past year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive. What we do know is ISIS holds at least one female aid worker, and possibly more. The International Federation of the Red Cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in October 2013 remain missing, but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbductions and killings of aid workers are, unfortunately, nothing new, but the numbers are. According to Aidworkersecurity.org, at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013, a 121% increase on 70 recorded killings the year before.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all were victims of ISIS, a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled Syria. In fact, according to the same report, it is the Taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers, in large part in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\\'s the difference: ISIS is changing the game. The Taliban may have many reasons for abductions (flexing their muscles, negotiating prisoner releases), but they also have a record of frequent hostage release. The need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters, or mattered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ISIS, it appears to matter less. Abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income (ISIS demanded at least $6 million for Kayla Mueller, and reportedly $200 million for two Japanese hostages) or, failing that, their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness. So far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by ISIS is extremely low, save for those whose ransoms were paid. The freeing of 19 kidnapped Assyrian Christians shocked many, because release is not a common part of ISIS\\' playbook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide, who may look to emulate ISIS\\' model of abduction and violence. One example is West African extremist group Boko Haram, which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies, an approach disturbingly similar to ISIS\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Humanitarian work has always been risky, but it\\'s never been more dangerous than it is now,\" says Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF . \"There used to be a time when an organization\\'s flag provided a great deal of protection. That\\'s no longer the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of Syria and its environs altogether, but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers. Still, outside workers like Mueller, Kassig, Henning and Haines were inside Syria when they were taken, and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations. Not only that, but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency, local staffers become bait. Indeed, the majority of victims have been working in their own countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nISIS doesn\\'t just target aid workers. Journalists, soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list. But in the Wild West that is Syria and its borders, few of these remain, save for aid workers. In a space devoid of government, refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities, the new front line in the war on terror, a sometimes unwelcome association. And as ISIS spreads beyond Syria\\'s borders, the risks grow further afield.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet despite these risks, thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million. While some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection, many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit. Their security and locations for the most part are under constant review.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen CNN approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences, and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level, many declined, in large part due to security concerns. For this reason, some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenior relief director for NGO working in the Syria region\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I think back, I\\'ve been doing this work for about 20 years, and I remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection, some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much, much more difficult; we\\'re asking people to put themselves in harm\\'s way in some circumstances. I mean, we don\\'t do that, but it\\'s not the exception any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotos: Photos: Syrian civil war in 2014 Photos: Photos: Syrian civil war in 2014 Syrian civil war in 2014 â\\x80\\x93 A wounded child walks at a makeshift hospital in the rebel-held town of Douma after being injured in a reported airstrike by government forces on Tuesday, December 23.

It\\'s hard; there are some areas where the family and friends don\\'t understand why you\\'re going there, and you re-articulate, \"If not you, then who?\" and you ask, \"Would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened?\"',\n",

Dozens of people died over three days of mayhem, with soldiers slaughtering local residents, displaced people and pilgrims, they said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of civilians are believed to have been killed since Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military operation against leaders in the Tigray region, sending in troops from the neighboring Amhara region. CNN has previously reported that soldiers from neighboring Eritrea have perpetrated many of the extrajudicial killings, assaults and human rights abuses in the Tigray region.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seizing control of Tigray\\'s main cities in late November, Abiy declared victory and maintained that no civilians were harmed in the offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are killing our people in this country, they are killing children, all ages of the population and they are conducting rape,\" Debretsion told CNN in a phone interview from an undisclosed location.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All sorts of acts of genocide have been committed in Tigray.

It added that it was \"fully committed\" to investigating any human rights violations.

Converting those screens to televisions then becomes a cheaper option, he adds, for \"citizens who have low incomes and cannot afford buying a brand-new TV.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this age of scrambling for the newest high-tech phone, tablet or television, refurbishing broken and outdated gadgets might seem impractical. But for many countries, it\\'s an important link in the value chain of e-waste management.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the UN-affiliated Global E-Waste Monitor report, nearly 54 million metric tons of e-waste was generated around the world in 2019. It includes everything from phones and computer monitors to larger appliances like refrigerators and old fax machines. Together, it weighs \" more than all the commercial airliners ever made ,\" according to the UN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRwanda is one of only 13 countries in Africa that have passed national legislation regarding e-waste regulation, according to the report. And it has led to the first official recycling and refurbishing facility in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers sort e-waste using a system of conveyor belts across Enviroserve\\'s recycling facility near Kigali.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperational since early last year, this public-private partnership between the government and Dubai-based Enviroserve became a source of pride for Rwanda. The state-of-the-art plant near Kigali can process up to 10,000 metric tons of e-waste per year.\\r\\n\\r\\nRwanda\\'s focus on local action\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to managing director Olivier Mbera, Enviroserve has already repaired and refurbished more than 5,000 computers, which were sold to public schools. To date, it has processed more than 4,000 tons of e-waste and created more than 600 jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve also mitigated more than 2,000 tons (of carbon), equivalent to emissions from all the equipment we have recycled,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nConveyor belts sort plastics from metals, while plexiglass chambers collect phosphor fumes from old tube TVs. Circuit boards pile up in bags and lithium batteries are constantly being tested.

Another 500,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses were due to be delivered by the end of the month.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, South Africa has switched to a new plan. It will start vaccinating health care workers with Johnson & Johnson shots in a research study.

       " 'All of the witnesses to this massacre have been given pseudonyms at their request due to fears of retribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbraham began burying the bodies in the morning and didn\\'t stop until nightfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corpses, some dressed in white church robes drenched in blood, were scattered in arid fields, scrubby farmlands and a dry riverbed. Others had been shot on their doorsteps with their hands bound with belts. Among the dead were priests, old men, women, entire families and a group of more than 20 Sunday school children, some as young as 14, according to eyewitnesses, parents and their teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbraham recognized some of the children immediately. They were from his town in Ethiopia\\'s northern Tigray region, Edaga Hamus, and had also fled fighting there two weeks earlier. As clashes raged, Abraham and his family, along with hundreds of other displaced people, escaped to Dengelat, a nearby village in a craggy valley ringed by steep, rust-colored cliffs. They sought shelter at Maryam Dengelat, a historic monastery complex famed for a centuries-old, rock-hewn church.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 30, they were joined by scores of religious pilgrims for the Orthodox festival of Tsion Maryam, an annual feast to mark the day Ethiopians believe the Ark of the Covenant was brought to the country from Jerusalem. The holy day was a welcome respite from weeks of violence, but it would not last.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of Eritrean soldiers opened fire on Maryam Dengelat church while hundreds of congregants were celebrating mass, eyewitnesses say. People tried to flee on foot, scrambling up cliff paths to neighboring villages. The troops followed, spraying the mountainside with bullets.\\r\\n\\r\\nA CNN investigation drawing on interviews with 12 eyewitnesses, more than 20 relatives of the survivors and photographic evidence sheds light on what happened next.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers went door to door, dragging people from their homes. Mothers were forced to tie up their sons. A pregnant woman was shot, her husband killed. Some of the survivors hid under the bodies of the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mayhem continued for three days, with soldiers slaughtering local residents, displaced people and pilgrims. Finally, on December 2, the soldiers allowed informal burials to take place, but threatened to kill anyone they saw mourning. Abraham volunteered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFootage obtained by CNN shows the shoes of some of those killed in Dengelat. Credit: Obtained by CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder their watchful eyes, he held back tears as he sorted through the bodies of children and teenagers, collecting identity cards from pockets and making meticulous notes about their clothing or hairstyle. Some were completely unrecognizable, having been shot in the face, Abraham said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he covered their bodies with earth and thorny tree branches, praying that they wouldn\\'t be washed away, or carried off by prowling hyenas and circling vultures. Finally he placed their shoes on top of the burial mounds, so he could return with their parents to identify them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne was Yohannes Yosef, who was just 15.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their hands were tied ... young children ... we saw them everywhere. There was an elderly man who had been killed on the road, an 80-something-year-old man. And the young kids they killed on the street in the open.

He accused the Tigray People\\'s Liberation Front (TPLF), which ruled Ethiopia for nearly three decades before Abiy took office in 2018, of attacking a government military base and trying to steal weapons. The TPLF denies the claim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conflict is the culmination of escalating tensions between the two sides, and the most dire of several recent ethno-nationalist clashes in Africa\\'s second-most populous country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seizing control of Tigray\\'s main cities in late November, Abiy declared victory and maintained that no civilians were harmed in the offensive. Abiy has also denied that soldiers from Eritrea crossed into Tigray to support Ethiopian forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the fighting has raged on in rural and mountainous areas where the TPLF and its armed supporters are reportedly hiding out, resisting Abiy\\'s drive to consolidate power. The violence has spilled over into local communities, catching civilians in the crossfire and triggering what the United Nations refugee agency has called the worst flight of refugees from the region in two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN special adviser on genocide prevention said in early February that the organization had received multiple reports of \"extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, looting, mass executions and impeded humanitarian access.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of those abuses have been blamed on Eritrean soldiers, whose presence on the ground suggests that Abiy\\'s much-lauded peace deal with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki set the stage for the two sides to wage war against the TPLF -- their mutual enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US State Department, in a statement to CNN, called for Eritrean forces to be \"withdrawn from Tigray immediately,\" citing credible reports of their involvement in \"deeply troubling conduct.\" In response to CNN\\'s findings, the spokesperson said \"reports of a massacre at Maryam Dengelat are gravely concerning and demand an independent investigation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEthiopia responded to CNN\\'s request for comment with a statement that did not directly address the attack in Dengelat. The government said it would \"continue bringing all perpetrators to justice following thorough investigations into alleged crimes in the region,\" but gave no details about those investigations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They were taking them barefoot and killing them in front of their mothers\" Rahwa\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN has reached out for comment to Eritrea, which has yet to respond. On Friday, the government vehemently denied its soldiers had committed atrocities during another massacre in Tigray reported by Amnesty International.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TPLF said in a statement to CNN that its forces were nowhere near Dengelat at the time of the massacre. It rejected that the victims could have been mistaken for being TPLF and called for a UN investigation to hold all sides accountable for atrocities committed during the conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, the situation inside the country remains opaque. Ethiopia\\'s government has severely restricted access to journalists and prevented most aid from reaching areas beyond the government\\'s control, making it challenging to verify accounts from survivors. And an intermittent communications blackout during the fighting has effectively blocked the war from the world\\'s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that curtain is being pulled back, as witnesses fleeing parts of Tigray reach internet access and phone lines are restored. They detail a disastrous conflict that has given rise to ethnic violence, including attacks on churches and mosques.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor months, rumors spread of a grisly assault on an Orthodox church in Dengelat. A list of the dead began circulating on social media in early December, shared among the Tigrayan diaspora. Then photos of the deceased, including young children, started cropping up online.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a network of activists and relatives, CNN tracked down eyewitnesses to the attack. In countless phone calls -- many disconnected and dropped -- Abraham and others provided the most detailed account of the deadly massacre to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nFootage of the 2019 festival shows congregants celebrating outside the church. Credit: Bernadette Gilbertas\\r\\n\\r\\nEyewitnesses said that the festival started much as it had any other year. Footage of the celebrations from 2019 shows priests dressed in white ceremonial robes and crowns, carrying crosses aloft, leading hundreds of people in prayer at Maryam Dengelat church. The faithful sang, danced and ululated in unison.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs prayers concluded in the early hours of November 30, Abraham looked out from the hilltop where the church is perched to see troops arriving by foot, followed by more soldiers in trucks. At first, they were peaceful, he said. They were invited to eat, and rested under the shade of a tree grove.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as congregants were celebrating mass around midday, shelling and gunfire erupted, sending people fleeing up mountain paths and into nearby homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesta, who helped with preparations for the festival, said he was at the church when troops arrived at the village entrance, blocking off the road and firing shots. He heard people screaming and fled, running up Ziqallay mountainside. From the rocky plateau he surveyed the chaos playing out below.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could see people running here and there ... [the soldiers] were killing everyone who was coming from the church,\" Desta said.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight eyewitnesses said they could tell the troops were Eritrean, based on their uniforms and dialect. Some speculated that soldiers were meting out revenge by targeting young men, assuming they were members of the TPLF forces or allied local militias. But Abraham and others maintained there were no militia in Dengelat or the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarta, who was visiting Dengelat for the holiday, says she left the church with her husband Biniam after morning prayers. As the newlyweds walked back to their relative\\'s home, a stream of people began sprinting up the hill, shouting that soldiers were rounding people up in the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiniam, left, and Marta on their wedding day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe recalled the horrifying moment soldiers arrived at their house, shooting into the compound and calling out: \"Come out, come out you b*tches.\" Marta said they went outside holding their identity cards aloft, saying \"we\\'re civilians.\" But the troops opened fire anyway, hitting Biniam, his sister and several others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was holding Bini, he wasn\\'t dead ... I thought he was going to survive, but he died [in my arms].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe couple had just been married in October. Marta found out after the massacre that she was pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the soldiers left, Marta, who said she was shot in the hand, helped drag the seven bodies inside, so that the hyenas wouldn\\'t eat them. \"We slept near the bodies ... and we couldn\\'t bury them because they [the soldiers] were still there,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Clockwise from left) Isayas Asgedom, Isaaq Isayas Asgedom, Arsema Yemane, Biniam Yemane and Alemtsahay Asgedom were all killed at the house where Marta was staying.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarta and other eyewitnesses described soldiers going house to house through Dengelat, dragging people outside, binding their hands or asking others to do so, and then shooting them.\\r\\n\\r\\nRahwa, who was part of the Sunday school group from Edaga Hamus and left Dengelat earlier than others, managing to escape being killed, said mothers were forced to tie up their sons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They were ordering their mothers to tie their sons\\' hands. They were taking them barefoot and killing them in front of their mothers,\" Rahwa said eyewitnesses told her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel, another eyewitness, said that he had eaten and drank with the soldiers before they came to his house, which is just behind the church, and killed his relatives. He said he survived by hiding underneath one of their bodies for hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They started pushing the people out of their houses and they were killing all children, women and old men. After they killed them outside their houses, they were looting and taking all the property,\" Samuel said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the violence raged, hundreds of people remained in the church hall. In a lull in the gunfire, priests advised those who could to go home, ushering them outside. Several of the priests were killed as they left the church, Abraham said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith nowhere to run to, Abraham sheltered inside Maryam Dengelat, lying on the floor as artillery pounded the tin roof. \"We lost hope and we decided to stay and die at the church. We didn\\'t try to run,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days later, the troops called parishioners down from the church to deal with the dead. Abraham said he and five other men spent the day burying bodies, including those from Marta\\'s household and the Sunday school children. But the troops forbid them from burying bodies at the church, in line with Orthodox tradition, and forced them to make mass graves instead -- a practice that has been described elsewhere in Tigray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"... most of them were eaten by vultures before they got buried, it was horrible\" Tedros\\r\\n\\r\\nAbraham shared photos and videos of the grave sites, which CNN geolocated to Dengelat with the help of satellite image analysis from several experts. The analysis was unable to conclusively identify individual graves, which witnesses said were shallow, but one expert said there were signs that parts of the landscape had changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial bloodshed was followed by a period of two tense weeks, Abraham said. Soldiers stayed in the area in several encampments, stealing cars, burning crops and killing livestock before eventually moving on.\\r\\n\\r\\nTedros, who was born in Dengelat and traveled there after the soldiers had left, said that the village smelled of death and that vultures were circling over the mountains, a sign that there may be more bodies left uncounted there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of them were also killed in the far fields while they were trying to escape and most of them were eaten by vultures before they got buried, it was horrible. [The soldiers] tied them and killed them in front of their doors, and they shot them in the head just to save bullets,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTedros visited the burial grounds described by eyewitnesses and said he saw cracks in the church walls where artillery hit. In interviews with villagers and family members, he compiled a death toll of more than 70 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe families hope that the names of their loved ones, which Tedros, Abraham and others risked their lives to record, will eventually be read out at a traditional funeral ceremony at the Maryam Dengelat church -- rare closure in an ongoing conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree months after the massacre, the graves in Dengelat are a daily reminder of the bloodshed for the survivors who remain in the village. But it has not yet been safe enough to rebury the bodies of those who died, and that reality is weighing on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrection: An on-screen title in an earlier version of the video in this story misstated the date of CNN-obtained footage from Tigray.

It will begin inoculating health workers in February, the health ministry told CNN, becoming one of the first countries in Africa to receive large doses of the Covid-19 vaccines.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Africa has also ordered another 20 million vaccines through a deal with Pfizer/BioNTech and expects to purchase another 9 million from Johnson & Johnson, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told a local media channel on Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers load South Africa\\'s first Covid-19 vaccines as they arrive at OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg on February 1\\r\\n\\r\\nSeychelles was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to start vaccinating its population, using doses of China\\'s Sinopham vaccine -- with a target to be the first to have 70% coverage among adults, according to a media release.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island of Mauritius also started vaccinating frontline workers on January 26 , after India donated 100,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, Guinea, in West Africa, ordered 55 doses of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine and gave the first doses to 25 officials, according to The Associated Press\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North Africa, Morocco and Algeria also recently began immunization programs, according to Our World in Data , an independent statistics website from Oxford University\\'s Global Change Data Lab.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn comparison to other regions, Africa was slow to start and is likely to be slow in catching up, health officials said.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmerging markets like South Africa have also found themselves paying more than their wealthier counterparts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPaying double\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Africa is the country worst affected by Covid-19 in Africa, recording nearly 1.5 million cases to date and more than 45,000 deaths. Its health ministry told CNN global competition forced it to purchase the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII) at nearly double the price -- $5.25 per dose, according to Reuters -- paid by other wealthier countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a global demand for the vaccine in the first quarter. We are not aware of a cheaper option that is immediately available,\" the health ministry\\'s head of communications, Popo Maja, said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SII did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis price is higher than the $3 per dose other African countries are reportedly set to pay in a deal the African Union (AU) secured two weeks ago. That order promises 270 million doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for African countries, again through the SII.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut few cheap vaccine options are available to African countries because of continued global demand, leaving the continent trailing behind, say government officials and health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking their own deals\\r\\n\\r\\nMost African countries suffered fewer deaths from the first wave of the virus last year compared to other parts of the world, but case numbers are now surging across the continent, particularly in the southern region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe African continent has recorded more than 3.6 million cases, while deaths increased by 40% since January 1 to reach 92,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Africa is also dealing with a new variant of the virus that emerged there, which health experts say is possibly more transmissible and capable of evading the effect of vaccines . It is driving record case numbers and has been detected in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Comoros, and Zambia as well as more than 20 non-African countries so far.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we don\\'t manage the situation we will end up with a moral catastrophe in our hands,\" the head of Africa\\'s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told CNN last week. \"If we have those vaccines and we continue to apply aggressively the public health measures, the issue of variants would disappear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, WHO set up the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a partnership to coordinate production and boost access to treatments, vaccines and tests.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOVAX, the ACT Accelerator\\'s vaccines branch, aims to distribute 2 billion Covid-19 doses globally by the end of this year, with 690 million forecast for Africa\\'s lower-income countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initiative is led by WHO; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. It will be funded by development agencies and donations from groups such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Gavi\\'s supply forecast is correct, the countries will only have enough to fully vaccinate 27% of their combined population, James Fulker, a spokesperson for Gavi, told CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO is asking richer countries to prioritize fair supply instead of making their own extensive deals with pharmaceutical companies or else share their unused doses with COVAX.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the health agency is encouraging poorer countries to secure additional coverage through their own deals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AU has also taken the lead in seeking out deals for its member countries, by setting up the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT).\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week, AVATT procured 400 million doses from the SII, adding to the 270 million secured in January, Nkengasong said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnger against vaccine nationalism\\r\\n\\r\\nThe global disparity in access to Covid-19 vaccines has caused widespread anger among Africa\\'s leaders, including South Africa\\'s president and chair of the AU, Cyril Ramaphosa, who warned during a World Economic Forum virtual meeting last week that richer countries are \"hoarding\" vaccines, and urged global action to ensure an equitable rollout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are concerned about vaccine nationalism,\" Ramaphosa said. \"The rich countries of the world went out and acquired large doses of vaccines from the developers and manufacturers of these vaccines and some countries have even gone beyond and acquired up to four times what their population needs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, Canada and the United Kingdom have purchased enough vaccines to cover 500% and 300% of their populations respectively, according to data from the Duke Global Health Innovation Center\\r\\n\\r\\nA patient receives an injection of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at a centre in the UK which has enough vaccines to cover 300% of its population\\r\\n\\r\\nThis behavior is marginalizing the countries that are \"most in need\" of the vaccine, Ramaphosa added.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO has echoed Ramaphosa\\'s words on several occasions, stating recently that the vaccine gap between rich and poor countries is widening.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational rollouts\\r\\n\\r\\nBut countries in sub-Saharan Africa are working with what they can to get some coverage underway.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhana is planning to procure 17.6 million doses of different vaccines by June, its President, Nana Akufo Addo, said while announcing new restrictions in a speech on Sunday. The West African nation of 30 million is fighting a second wave, with nearly 67,000 cases reported and a record daily total of 1,583 cases on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn East Africa, Kenya will begin vaccinating this month and hopes to have 1.25 million people inoculated before June, according to its health ministry on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nUganda, with a population of around 44 million, plans to access vaccines through COVAX and its health ministry has said it will try to procure more from AstraZeneca It is also exploring the possibility of getting vaccines from China, if WHO approves its vaccine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Nigeria, Africa\\'s most populous nation, officials say they will begin to receive vaccine doses this month through COVAX. The health minister, Osagie Enanire, is also working with the AU to secure vaccines from its deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country has been grappling with a shortage of oxygen and rising case numbers. Nigeria will receive 16 million doses in COVAX\\'s initial distribution, the third most of any country globally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value of sharing\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the progress made, African countries on the whole face a long wait in receiving Covid-19 vaccines. For example, less than 20% of the 270 million doses first ordered by the AU will be available before June, according to a press release from the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOVAX forecasts that by that time it will have supplied 640 million doses, about 30% of which are for AU countries, Fulker said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, the European Union expects member states to vaccinate 70% of their adult populations by the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is in their common interest, in the collective interest that people get vaccinated in a timely fashion all over so that we can get out of this pandemic as a collective,\" Nkengasong told CNN. \"There\\'s no way only parts of the world like the richer nations will get out of this without the southern hemisphere also getting out of the pandemic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his opening remarks at the 148th session of the WHO executive board on January 18, its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyses, said the approach of first world countries was \"self-defeating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development and approval of safe and effective vaccines less than a year after the emergence of a new virus is providing a much-needed source of hope.

       " 'Blantyre, Malawi (CNN) Even before Andrew Simbota arrived at the small, rural Mulanje district hospital on Saturday afternoon, doctors here wondered how they would treat him. They were down to two oxygen tanks for their entire Covid-19 ward. A serious patient like Simbota can use up to three canisters of high-flow oxygen a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ambulance driver pulled to the top of the hillside, Simbota, too weak to move, was left on a stretcher at the main entrance of the red brick building. The minutes wore on, his bare chest expanding, and then cratering as he took struggled breaths through a blue surgical mask. His stretcher parked in quiet corner, away from foot traffic and staff members who gathered near the reception desk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter more than an hour in the searing midday heat, Simbota\\'s family pulled up to the entrance in a small hatchback. Four of them struggled to pull him off the stretcher and squeeze him into the back. His wife cradled his head, covering his feverish body with a green and black blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People come here to die, we don\\'t want him here at this place,\" said his niece.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere shifts are measured in days not hours\\r\\n\\r\\nA dramatic second wave of Covid-19 in Malawi, fueled by the new variant first discovered in neighboring South Africa, has inundated much of its health infrastructure, leaving many families to make agonizing choices, and exposed the danger of deep inequalities in Covid-19 vaccine distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I used to do regular rounds at district hospitals. It was a way for us to ensure the quality of care across the country,\" says Dr. Tamara Phiri, a specialist treating Covid-19 patients at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, the largest hospital in Southern Malawi.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut like many of Phiri\\'s other responsibilities, her district visits ended when Covid-19 struck in earnest in Blantyre and her home hospital\\'s Covid-19 admissions hovered near capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Tamara Phiri consults with a patient in a general ward.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalawi -- and Queen\\'s hospital -- seemed to be spared the worst during the first wave of Covid-19 -- a fact many, including Phiri attributed to its young and mostly rural population. But not during this wave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to official government data, the record for confirmed single day Covid-19 cases was nearly seven times higher at the very peak of this second wave compared to the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first three weeks of January, the number of severe Covid-19 patients at Queen\\'s hospital shot up from 12 to 107 cases, says Doctors Without Borders (MSF.)\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day, Phiri passes a white tent pitched in the hospital courtyard on her way to the Covid-19 ward â\\x80\\x94 it is where they disinfect the bodies of the patients she couldn\\'t save. \"That\\'s one of the most traumatic things. We see people die all the time, but not like this. Not at this rate, not this many people who were well just a week or two ago. It can get quite brutal,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your emotions are very blurred -- you don\\'t know when to be the doctor that has lost patients and when to be the family member that has lost people - you are bereaved,\" she says. \"And then, when do you become a Malawian that is worried for the whole country, because literally the country is bleeding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Malawi struggles against a second wave of Covid-19 oxygen shortages have posed major problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealthcare workers have been hit particularly hard. Before the pandemic, the impoverished country in Southern Africa could only just manage its healthcare. Now doctors and nurses are calling in sick and several have died from the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhiri indicates the offices of fellow senior physicians who are now sick: \"The one that sits next door, the one after that, the one after that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll told, of the eight specialists working in her hospital\\'s converted Covid-19 wards, only three are left to tend to more than 80 Covid-19 positive patients.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccines needed now\\r\\n\\r\\nBut specialists like Phiri and frontline health workers in Malawi and across the rest of the continent will likely only get access to vaccines long after becoming available to young, healthy people in the US and Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalawi\\'s national vaccination plan is dependent on COVAX, the World Health Organization-backed facility organized to help poor countries access Covid-19 vaccines. Its government promised last week that the first consignment of the AstraZeneca vaccine will arrive by the end of February. But healthcare workers are preparing for a much longer wait, skeptical they will be delivered anywhere near that schedule because of regulatory red tape, and worried by an announcement Sunday by South African scientists that show the vaccine provides \"minimal protection\" against the variant discovered there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s brutal, but it is the reality,\" says Phiri. She says it reminds her of the fight against HIV/AIDS, where life-saving anti-retroviral drugs were available in the United States to combat the virus years before they became available in countries like Malawi -- one of the worst affected countries in that pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Phiri (right) talks to a nurse in a coronavirus ward.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fight against the coronavirus, rich countries with only 16 percent of the world\\'s population have already reserved around 60 percent of the available vaccine supply, according to ongoing monitoring by Duke University researchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn current schedules, it could take years to get enough vaccines to Malawi to inoculate the general population and stop infection waves. MSF says the immediate goal should be to get 40,000 doses, enough to vaccinate all of the country\\'s overburdened frontline healthcare workers\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The issue with vaccines right now is more a time issue than a quantity issue,\" says Marion Pechayre, the head of MSF in Malawi, whose team is using every available bit of space outside of Queen\\'s hospital to build triage tents and consulting areas for possible Covid-19 patients for this and future waves of the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical charity is trying to buy directly from the pharmaceutical companies to donate to frontline medical workers. Otherwise, they say, the health system could collapse. So far, pharma companies have only negotiated directly with governments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we vaccinate and prioritize frontline medical personnel quickly enough, the health care system won\\'t be as badly affected as if we don\\'t. It seems unfair and unreasonable not to,\" says Pechayre.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo afraid to seek help\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coronavirus has also impacted health in Malawi indirectly, by scaring people away from seeking treatment for other issues. Many worry they won\\'t receive care from an overburdened staff, or worse that they will catch Covid-19 during their visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter finishing her Covid-19 rounds for the day, Phiri heads to one of the hospital\\'s general wards, to prep a final year student for his last internal medicine exam. He carefully exams the only patient in a row of empty cots, reporting back to Phiri.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general ward has more than sixty beds and is usually full of malaria cases and patients with chronic problems, but it is now largely empty. People are just too afraid to come to the hospital, Phiri says. \"It is a disaster waiting to happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMany will die at home\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from Queens hospital and into the periphery of Malawi\\'s health care, smaller district hospitals and clinics face all of the same pressures, only magnified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the immaculate Thyolo district hospital, to the South of Blantyre, Dr. Arnold Jumbe shows his small Covid-19 isolation ward where several patients -- including a clinician --are recovering from the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccinating doctors will shore up the hospital\\'s minimal resources and dispel some of the myths about it swirling on social media and in the local press, Jumbe says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As healthcare workers we are ready to take the vaccine. We were ready even by yesterday to take the vaccine. Yes, because we need to be safe,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nNurses work on the roster inside one of four wards converted for Covid-19 patients at Queen Elizabeth hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccinating healthcare workers would be the first step in shoring up a failing health system -- and crucially, in restoring Malawians\\' confidence in their hospitals. But until then, families don\\'t know where to turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Simbota\\'s family left Mulanje district hospital, they rushed to find him care that they felt they could trust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family couldn\\'t afford the mission hospital in town. The next village\\'s district clinic doesn\\'t treat Covid-19 patients -- so they referred the family back to Mulanje.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday morning, the approach to Simbota\\'s modest brick house was blocked with branches and leaves strewn across the red dirt road. It was a symbol, prepared by his neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man passed by on a bicycle. \"Andrew Simbota died last night,\" he said.',\n",

It\\'s a cornerstone of what makes her the distinguished multimedia artist she is today, with a resume that includes Netflix , Google and Coca-Cola . And in Johannesburg, where she lives, it\\'s hard to miss her murals sprawled across everything from water towers to basketball courts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I started my (art) journey, I was really inspired by hip-hop, rap and basketball, and I\\'d always seen this theme of Nike Air Force 1s and Air Jordans,\" she recalls. \"I\\'d always associated that with Black people really creating groundbreaking, global, effective work and I really wanted to be a part of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Nike to Netflix, this illustrator is making noise with her artwork\\r\\n\\r\\nEven from a young age, Poppy felt she needed to look the part. Growing up in the small mining town of Vereeniging, south of Johannesburg, she says she did not meet an artist until she was in high school -- and her family did not greet her decision to pursue an art career with excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Forbes\\' \" 30 Under 30 \" creative found a supportive community through sneaker culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People identify from their sole, S-O-L-E, on purpose,\" says DeJongh \"Dee\" Wells, a self-proclaimed \"sneakerhead\" and creator of the podcast \"Obsessive Sneaker Disorder (OSD).\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth African multimedia artist Karabo Poppy in streetwear clothing she designed for label Rich Mnisi.

By having those boxes serve as her \"vision board,\" he says, \"(Poppy) was speaking what she\\'s doing today into existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWells\\' statement holds truth for the 28-year-old illustrator. She has collaborated with Nike on several occasions, starting in 2019 when she designed three styles of Air Force 1s that sold out in a matter of days, and even landed on the feet of basketball legend LeBron James\\r\\n\\r\\nPoppy shows off one of her first Nike Air Force 1 shoe designs, with her name stitched on the back. Credit: Bruce Buttery for CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Air Force 1 has been both an inspiration and a launching pad for Poppy\\'s career. From drawing on the shoes with whiteout in high school, to painting her first mural while wearing a pair, she says it was monumental to see her name stitched onto a shoe that\\'s been such a big part of her journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost recently, she worked with Nike on a release of the Jordan \"Why Not?\" Zer0.4 sneaker, basketball player Russell Westbrook\\'s latest signature shoe\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of sneaker culture\\r\\n\\r\\nSneaker culture is hard to define, says Elizabeth Semmelhack, historian and senior curator at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, she says, it\\'s a group of individuals interested in the history and the storytelling opportunities offered by sneakers. \"Companies make these things, but it\\'s culture that transformed them into objects that have meaning,\" Semmelhack tells CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt \"Clyde\" Frazier in 1971 shown here playing basketball with the first iteration of the \"Puma Clyde\" shoes.

Both he and Semmelhack describe the moment when the famously well-dressed New York Knicks basketball star Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier teamed up with Puma to make the Puma Clyde shoe as a turning point in function-to-fashion footwear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simultaneous birth of break-dancing and hip-hop in New York City also fed into the burgeoning sneakerhead trend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You begin to see how this intertwining of music, sport, dance, fashion, New York kind of all begin to weave together in the 1970s. This paves the way for the huge cultural uptake in sneakers,\" says Semmelhack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Nike \"Air Jordan\" shoes worn by Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan, circa 1985.

His dominant success as a player and global popularity boosted shoe sales; Jordans have gone on to become one of the bestselling shoe lines to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time a young Poppy encountered sneaker culture in the early 2000s, it had become a full-fledged global phenomenon. Shoe exchanges have since popped up in Cape Town, while African brands are growing across the continent and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the most diverse culture that I know,\" says Wells. \"I\\'ve been to parts of the world where I don\\'t even know the native language, but a simple point, head nod, or thumbs up, basically saying \\'I see you, I see your kicks, I like your kicks.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCreative inspiration\\r\\n\\r\\nUniting Poppy\\'s diverse artistic output is a central theme: creating images that \"preserve the African aesthetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe says inspiration comes from a seemingly ordinary place -- the barbershop.

       " '(CNN) It was a kidnapping as brazen as it was unexpected.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the numbers are murky, more than 300 schoolboys are still missing after an attack on a boys\\' school in northwest Nigeria nearly a week ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of attackers riding motorbikes ambushed the children at the school.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They said they were not here to rob us, that we shouldn\\'t run. \\'We are going to help you,\\'\" said 13-year-old Khalid Yargobe, who escaped over a wall with scores of his classmates as attackers breached the wall of his school.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile kidnapping for ransom by criminal elements in Katsina state have seen a disturbing increase, an abduction of this scale is unheard of.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a reminder of the brutal kidnapping of 276 girls from Chibok in 2014 by terror group Boko Haram. More than 100 of those girls never returned home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, an audio message surfaced claiming responsibility for the kidnapping, purportedly from Abubakar Shekau, the leader of a faction of terror group Boko Haram.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatsina State governor Aminu Bello Masari told CNN that officials have yet to see any concrete evidence that the boys were taken by the group.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the claim is true, it is a deeply disturbing shift of the influence of Boko Haram. For a decade, various factions of the group have killed tens of thousands of civilians, and displaced millions, in their stronghold hundreds of miles away in northeast Nigeria.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchool bags of the kidnapped students are seen inside their classroom in Kankara, Nigeria on Wednesday, December 16, 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nMission accomplished?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost exactly five years ago, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari claimed that the government had \"technically defeated\" Boko Haram.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile clearly politically motivated, there was some truth to his controversial declaration at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the months previously the Nigerian military, with international support and critical operational involvement from a coalition of regional states, pushed Boko Haram out of a huge swath of territory that the insurgents controlled in Borno State at the border regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March of 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS central in Syria and Iraq. Despite the clear ideological common ground between the two extremist groups, it was widely seen as a move made out of desperation as they were being hammered on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nPledging fealty to ISIS led to a leadership struggle and fracture, with Boko Haram splitting into at least two separate groups. One led by Shekau and the other calling itself Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of territory and infighting significantly reduced the threat of open combat, and the military freed countless kidnapped girls and women as they regained control.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoko Haram then shifted even more to brutally unconventional tactics like suicide attacks, sometimes carried out by kidnapped girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut despite a relative period of peace, close observers of the Lake Chad basin believed there was always the threat of a resurgence.\\r\\n\\r\\nCycles of Violence\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand why, you need to look at the origins of Boko Haram itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group emerged in the early 2000s in Maiduguri, in Borno State. \"Boko Haram\" is really a nickname -- their official name translates to \"People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet\\'s Teaching and Jihad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the nickname is apt -- it means \"education\" or \"western education\" is forbidden and the group\\'s origins can be explained, in part, by their strict Salafist interpretation of Islam.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several years Boko Haram grew relatively peacefully -- drawing supporters angered by the perceived threat of western education and morals coming from the federal government and seeping in from Nigeria\\'s south (which is largely Christian). They also tapped into popular frustration at high levels of corruption and ineptitude from the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is impossible to attribute any single factor to Boko Haram\\'s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat mission led to its founder Some argue that the terror group\\'s evolution into its current violent form can be traced back to a significant security operation against its members in 2009.That mission led to its founder Mohammed Yusuf\\'s capture and killing.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust last week, the international criminal court at the Hague accused both the terror group and the Nigerian security forces of potential crimes against humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nA staggering 10,000 people, many of them children, have died in detention during the conflict, according to a report by Amnesty International released in May.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Africa context, this cycle of violence between the state or conventional militaries and extremist insurgencies have played out in the Lake Chad region, the Sahel, Somalia and, in a recent troubling addition, Northern Mozambique.\\r\\n\\r\\nNigerian soldiers walk inside the school on December 15, where gunmen abducted students in Kankara, Nigeria.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuns won\\'t solve it\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s debatable whether Boko Haram ever enjoyed broad popular support in some regions. But their recent activity has eroded what support they did have and led to public anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this month, a group of militants on motorcycles killed more than 100 men and women near Maiduguri. They were part of a farming community.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Mohammed Awwal, a member of a local vigilante group, the attacks were reprisals because the community refused to give Boko Haram their food, a mafia-style arrangement that had previously kept them safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They tied their hands behind their backs and cut off their heads,\" Awwal said, quoting an eyewitness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever you explain their origins, Boko Haram has long been an insurgent group that preys on civilians, a parasite, really: taking food; women and girls as wives or slaves; kidnapping boys to ransom, swap for prisoners, or put into the field of battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut despite assurances from the government, the military and police aren\\'t always viewed much better by many Nigerians. The recent #ENDSars protests are an offshoot of this anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, there is broad consensus that guns alone won\\'t extinguish the threat of Boko Haram for good.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do that, there needs to be a wholesale change in strategy that broadens the focus to building community trust and opportunities. A focus on reconciliation, not violence. And for politicians brave enough to do it.',\n",

Consisting of roughly 90 volunteers ranging from engineers to medical professionals, the group was formed early last year with the goal of shoring up South Africa\\'s supply of medical ventilators.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to SAVE-P founder Justin Corbett, South Africa had a total of 3,800 ventilators at the start of the pandemic to cover a population of over 58 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy comparison, the UK, with a population of 66 million, had nearly 11,000 ventilators by mid-April; by the end of June, that number had risen to 30,000\\r\\n\\r\\nJUST WATCHED Watch: How South African ingenuity helped propel ventilator manufacturing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch: How South African ingenuity helped propel ventilator manufacturing 04:50\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was part of a global scramble to acquire lifesaving equipment. But for most countries across Africa , including South Africa, obtaining medical equipment is often complicated and cost prohibitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs South Africa experienced its first wave of cases -- the most of any African country -- Corbett and SAVE-P decided to look inward and tap into local experts like Whittle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacked by the Solidarity Fund -- a network of public and private donors formed in SA as a response to the Covid-19 crisis -- the group has since produced 2,000 ventilators. All of these are currently in use in hospitals around the country as South Africa simultaneously battles a second wave of cases and the emergence of a new variant from within its own borders.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiecing the puzzle together\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with ventilators is in Whittle\\'s blood. His father was a ventilator tech who owned his own business repairing medical equipment. Whittle took over at 18 and has been working with the machines ever since. He credits his collecting habit to his father, who told him that there was always a use for everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, you can ask Whittle about any one of the multitudes of metal machines stacked upon each other and he turns into a veritable museum curator, excitedly detailing the name of the machine, where it was made, if it\\'s still in production, and what it was meant for.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAVE-P founder Justin Corbett (left) and ventilator technician Robin Whittle (right) in Whittle\\'s garage in Durban, South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nA deeper exploration into these piles unearths everything from radios used in the 1970s and spare ventilator parts from the 1950s to old oxygen regulators. When SAVE-P reached out last March for his expertise on suitable ventilators to use as a model for its device, he knew the exact one he had to find.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I immediately thought of the Penlon Nuffield 200 . I worked with these ventilators from the seventies and eighties,\" he says, adding \"it was a military ventilator made in the UK.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says he zeroed in on this particular model because it was pneumatic, meaning it could operate without electricity -- a feature that increases the ventilator\\'s usability beyond established hospitals to include rural regions and field hospitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorbett acknowledges the group took inspiration from the Penlon machine and tweaked features from the original model to make the SAVE-P CPAP 100 , a high flow CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) unit that keeps patients\\' airways open without obstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth African ingenuity shifts into high gear\\r\\n\\r\\nWith international supply chains disrupted, South African automakers and manufacturers played a key role in making the ventilator. According to Corbett, that sector was the ideal candidate to transition into creating the parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The automotive sector has the right DNA, and it\\'s absolutely safety critical,\" he says. \"When we started looking at the documentation that we have for the automotive industry and what you require for the medical industry, the two are almost identical.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Pretoria-based automaker MCR Manufacturing, the transition made economic sense.

According to Whittle, being off even a hundredth of a millimeter in the milling of a piece would change the entire dynamics of the machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nA model for the future\\r\\n\\r\\nProbing corruption allegations , an audit by South Africa\\'s Special Investigating Unit revealed that throughout 2020, the South African government spent $26 billion on relief efforts, of which $632 million was spent to source PPE internationally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ventilators made by SAVE-P cost just over $1,000, a fraction of the price of similar ventilators on the market, according to Corbett. He adds that the group also created a mobile medical oxygen machine, an integral piece of equipment that takes oxygen and air and converts it for ventilator use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAVE-P project produced all 2,000 ventilators locally in South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother South African group, Akacia Medical, has also manufactured ventilators for use within the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the recent rise in Covid-19 cases across South Africa, Corbett says there are no plans for SAVE-P to make additional ventilators at this time, but that the warehouse stands ready and willing if asked to help.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the second wave continues to hit, he hopes the experience of locally producing ventilators could serve as a model for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Whittle, that means looking no further than his dusty old garage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We know for a fact now that we can manufacture products here that don\\'t have to be imported,\" he says. \"We have the infrastructure.

China has a rapidly developing economy with many sectors dependent on fossil fuels and it currently contributes 26% of global carbon emissions, according to the Green Belt and Road Initiative Center (Green-BRI).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October, one month after Xi promised carbon neutrality, one of China\\'s biggest energy construction firms, state-owned PowerChina, flew 223 Chinese employees into Zimbabwe to \"accelerate\" the expansion of the coal-fired Hwange Power Plant in the west of Zimbabwe. Two weeks later, the Chinese Ambassador to the country, Guo Shaochun, said in a tweet that the coronavirus pandemic \"cannot stop the pace of cooperation between China and Zimbabwe\" and that on completion of the project, the country\\'s \"power self-sufficiency capacity will be greatly improved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican governments have been happy to push ahead with dirty energy projects that only the Chinese will finance. The potential of a competent energy infrastructure fueled by cheap coal is enticing for a country like Zimbabwe, given the energy deficits slowing economic growth. The country has a national power demand ranging from 2,200-2,400 megawatts but only provides about 1,300, according to the Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG).\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese President Xi Jinping (right) shakes hands with his Zimbabwean counterpart President, Emmerson Mnangagwa on September 5, 2018, a day after the conclusion of the Forum On China-Africa Cooperation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnergy shortages and power cuts are commonplace in Ghana, exacerbated by drought conditions because of the country\\'s dependency on hydro-electricity. Its energy crisis left it vulnerable to energy developers and foreign investment before Ezekiel intervened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other countries investing in Africa, China also promises jobs, while taking advantage of lax policies and cheaper construction costs. Many governments choose to meet the demand for energy at the cost of a clean environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is despite every African country having ratified the Paris Agreement, apart from Angola, Libya, South Sudan and Eritrea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Policy on renewable projects is weak or non-existent in Africa,\" said Han Chen, the manager of international energy policy at the New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit international environmental advocacy group. \"In China, environmental standards are pretty high, while South Africa or Kenya, for example, have energy policies that make it easier for investors to get involved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf current plans go ahead, the Chinese-backed coal power output in Africa currently being financed could treble by the time the country realizes its goal of carbon neutrality in 2060, according to Global Energy Monitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to a request for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivism across the continent\\r\\n\\r\\nEzekiel is not alone in fighting for an Africa focused on renewable energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRioTinto RIO The Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA) has served letters to RioZim, formerly owned by London-listed mining corporation, over plans for a 2,800-megawatt plant in the northern Gokwe region, west of the capital Harare.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will receive financial assistance from the construction company China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC), and country risk insurance costs are likely to be covered by the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), according to Global Energy Monitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nZELA says the project is shrouded in secrecy and RioZim has not provided information on the environmental or socio-economic impacts of the plant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is likely the land earmarked for the plant is under communal settlements, meaning there would be relocations and appropriation of land, say ZELA. Living near coal plants can cause respiratory issues, affect water quality and increase the alkalinity of soil, according to Thermal Watch\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen contacted for comment, RioZim replied that \"any media engagements are strictly prohibited\" under the provision of their \"non-disclosure agreements.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Africa\\'s $10 billion, 3,000-megawatt Musina-Makhado power station will be financed by Chinese companies, both state-owned and private, with PowerChina alone contributing $4.5 billion, according to a memorandum of agreement signed in July 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is part of the proposed Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Limpopo province north of Pretoria, a mega industrial hub which will span more than 6,000 hectares.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pre-feasibility study conducted by UK engineering consultancy Mott MacDonald said direct impacts of the site where the coal plant will be located include \"detrimental effect on the biodiversity assets of the region,\" \"disruption of ecological functioning and pollution of water resources\" and \"large-scale land transformation.\" There will be a \"definite\" release of \"significant\" greenhouse emissions, according to a preliminary impact assessment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The country can\\'t afford to be locking in to a hugely polluting, expensive and carbon-intensive mega project at a time when â\\x80\\x94 more than ever â\\x80\\x94 we need to act against the climate crisis, protect the resilience of vulnerable, water scarce areas and preserve our limited state funds and resources for projects with positive outcomes and benefits for all,\" said Michelle Koyama, an attorney at Cape Town\\'s non-profit Centre for Environmental Rights (CER).\\r\\n\\r\\nCER has objected to the Musina-Makhado SEZ because of these negative climate impacts and say it will take water away from areas already experiencing deficits. South Africa has been plagued by droughts and water scarcity , and is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Limpopo Provincial Government, PowerChina and the Chinese embassy in South Africa did not respond to requests for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nEast of Pretoria, Kusile Power Station is being constructed with $2.5 billion from China Development Bank and sponsorship from Eskom, South Africa\\'s biggest polluter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people have moved in from rural areas and neighboring Zimbabwe to find work at the Medupi coal power plant, pictured here from Maropong township outside Lephalele, South Africa in January 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South African environment department launched a criminal investigation against the electric public utility company in May 2019 over air quality concerns at its Kendal Power Station.\\r\\n\\r\\nEskom confirmed to CNN that it has been summoned to appear in front of a regional court to answer to criminal charges related to the Kendal plant. These include exceeding the emissions limit on air pollutants and supplying false or misleading information to an air quality officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFossil fuel advocates argue that the energy provided by the plants is vital for development, but centralized coal has failed to deliver electricity to over 2.5 million households in South Africa and can be costly, according to Greenpeace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Despite the government promising to provide the people of South Africa with affordable electricity, many of them cannot afford Eskom\\'s coal-powered electricity -- the costs of which continue to escalate,\" said Koyama. \"Ironically the same communities who live next door to these coal plants, and have to suffer their impacts daily, do not have reliable, affordable electricity in their homes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2017 report written by Mike Holland, a member of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economist, estimated that more than 2,200 deaths a year could be attributed to coal-fired generation in South Africa. Lung cancer, heart disease stroke and respiratory infections were common killers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo coal plant brings health benefits and Chinese companies are not alone in receiving criticism for financing their construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014 Safi Energy Company secured $900 million from the Bank of Japan to build a coal plant in the west of Morocco. Described as a double standard and a danger to public health by Greenpeace, the environmental NGO estimated the plant is the cause of 59 premature deaths in the North African country annually, a figure that would be more than four times lower if Japanese emission limits were applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHSBC FTRXX JPMorgan Chase JPM Deutsche Bank DB Between 2014 and 2017 European and US banks likeandloaned $921 million to the potentially criminal Eskom, according to data compiled by a number of non-profit and environmental organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Coal investments come with a lot of human rights violations,\" Nqobizitha Ndlovu, a constitutional and human rights lawyer who is the legal adviser to ZELA, told CNN in a phone conversation. \"There are a lot of complaints here in Zimbabwe, and across all of Africa, that these projects do not respect the right to be healthy, to have a safe and clean environment or the right to water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked whether they would reevaluate their relationship with Eskom in light of the criminal charges, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever while western companies have pulled back from investment in coal plants, Chinese plans are still forging ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re locking a lot of countries into a coal-dependent pathway and the pollution can be horrendous,\" said Chen.\\r\\n\\r\\nA green future\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seeing his 2016 campaign empower communities, Ezekiel is hopeful. He spent four days speaking with chiefs, elders, fishermen and other local groups in Ekumfi, explaining the positives of renewable energy, especially the possibilities for long-term employment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We agree that there are people who are unemployed and that jobs are critical,\" said Ezekiel. \"But we believe that there\\'s a better alternative in the area of renewable energy which guarantees employment not only for the short term, but for a long time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChen agrees, saying there was \"pushback\" from communities. \"There\\'s sometimes a disconnect between a national bilateral agreement and what those on the ground actually want,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nEzekiel launched the Children for Climate Action (C4C) initiative to involve children (as well as young people) in the fight against climate change and the no coal debate. As a national coordinator of 350 Ghana Reducing our Carbon (350 G-ROC), Ezekiel is also encouraging other African countries (particularly Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria) to resist foreign investment in coal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A huge mobilization of young people is needed to create more public awareness and education, but we must provide skills and facilities for the youth to be employed, so we can demonstrate that energy indeed provides more job opportunities,\" Ezekiel said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCampaigners draw public attention to Chibeze Ezekiel\\'s movement on the dangers of coal and the need for renewables at a shopping mall in Accra, Ghana in September 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pan-African activism has had some success and in recent years coal projects have been shelved in Nigeria, Mozambique and Botswana, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent months, Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and chairman of the African Union, has dramatically shifted his country\\'s energy stance toward renewables. About 11,800-megawatts will be added to South Africa\\'s energy capacity by 2022, with \"more than half\" coming from renewable sources, he said in an address on October 15, adding that steps like these can help achieve a \"sufficient, secure and reliable energy supply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCER has successfully stopped the construction of a proposed 557-megawatt plant at Thabametsi alongside environmental organizations Earthlife and Groundwork. It is challenging the environmental authorization for another at Khanyisa, where a water-use licence has already been rescinded.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the intercontinental stage, Ezekiel is encouraged by the election of Joe Biden as the next president of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would say it is a victory not only for the US, but for the world as a whole,\" he said. \"He has made comments to the effect that he is prepared to put America back into the Paris agreement. That\\'s a very big plus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChina has actually become the largest green finance market, with about 11 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion) in green credit and about 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion) in green bonds, according to Green-BRI. Growing this market has helped control the pollution and ecological damage resulting from 40 years of extreme economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately coal is a fading industry and China is almost alone in financing coal power in Africa. As banks in other countries continue to snub the fuel, it\\'s likely that Chinese money will build the last ever coal plant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the economic behemoth wants to take its commitment to fighting global warming seriously, it needs to stop financing coal plants overseas. For Ezekiel and other activists, the war is turning in their favor.',\n",
       " 'Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo â\\x80\\x94 Showing early symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, the patient sits quietly on her bed, wrangling two toddlers desperate to flee the cell-like hospital room in Ingende, a remote town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are waiting for the results of a test for Ebola.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient can only communicate with her relatives through a clear plastic observation window. Her identity is secret, to protect her from being ostracized by locals fearful of Ebola infection . Her children have also been tested but, for now, show no symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a vaccine and a treatment for Ebola, which have brought down the rate at which it kills.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the question at the back of everyone\\'s mind is: What if this woman doesn\\'t have Ebola? What if, instead, she is patient zero of \"Disease X,\" the first known infection of a new pathogen that could sweep the world as fast as Covid-19, but one that has Ebola\\'s 50% to 90% fatality rate?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Disease X\" is hypothetical for now, an outbreak that scientists and public health experts fear could lead to serious disease around the world if and when it occurs, according to WHO. \"X\" stands for unexpected\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor Dadin Bonkole works at the Ingende Hospital\\'s Ebola Red Zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn\\'t the stuff of science fiction. It\\'s a scientific fear, based on scientific facts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve all got to be frightened,\" the patient\\'s physician, Dr. Dadin Bonkole, said. \"Ebola was unknown. Covid was unknown. We have to be afraid of new diseases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThreat to humanity\\r\\n\\r\\nHumanity faces an unknown number of new and potentially fatal viruses emerging from Africa\\'s tropical rainforests, according to Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, who helped discover the Ebola virus in 1976 and has been on the frontline of the hunt for new pathogens ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are now in a world where new pathogens will come out,\" he told CNN. \"And that\\'s what constitutes a threat for humanity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a young researcher, Muyembe took the first blood samples from the victims of a mysterious disease that caused hemorrhages and killed about 88% of patients and 80% of the staff who were working at the Yambuku Mission Hospital when the disease was first discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vials of blood were sent to Belgium and the US, where scientists found a worm-shaped virus. They called it \"Ebola,\" after the river close to the outbreak in the country that was then known as Zaire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe identification of Ebola relied on a chain that connected the most remote parts of Africa\\'s rainforests to high-tech laboratories in the West.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the West must rely on African scientists in the Congo and elsewhere to act as the sentinels to warn against future diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ingende, the fears of encountering a new, deadly, virus remained very real even after the recovery of the patient showing symptoms that looked like Ebola. Her samples were tested on site and sent on to the Congo\\'s National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa, where they were further tested for other diseases with similar symptoms. All came back negative, the illness that affected her remains a mystery.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking exclusively to CNN in the DRC\\'s capital, Kinshasa, Muyembe warned of many more zoonotic diseases -- those that jump from animals to humans -- to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nYellow fever, various forms of influenza, rabies, brucellosis and Lyme disease are among those that pass from animals to humans, often via a vector such as a rodent or an insect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey\\'ve caused epidemics and pandemics before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIV emerged from a type of chimpanzee and mutated into a world-wide modern plague. SARS, MERS and the Covid-19 virus known as SARS-CoV-2 are all coronaviruses that jumped to humans from unknown \"reservoirs\" -- the term virologists use for virus\\' natural hosts -- in the animal kingdom. Covid-19 is thought to have originated in China, possibly in bats.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes Muyembe think future pandemics could be worse than Covid-19, more apocalyptic? \"Yes, yes, I think so,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew viruses on the rise\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the first animal-to-human infection, yellow fever, was identified in 1901, scientists have found at least another 200 viruses known to cause disease in humans. According to research by Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, new species of viruses are being discovered at a rate of three to four a year. The majority of them originate from animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts say the rising number of emerging viruses is largely the result of ecological destruction and wildlife trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs their natural habitats disappear, animals like rats, bats, and insects survive where larger animals get wiped out. They\\'re able to live alongside human beings and are frequently suspected of being the vectors that can carry new diseases to humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nA passenger boat stops for a break on the shores of Ingende. These boats can take weeks to make their way down-river to Kinshasa.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists have linked past Ebola outbreaks to heavy human incursion into the rainforest. In one 2017 study , researchers used satellite data to determine that 25 of the 27 Ebola outbreaks located along the limits of the rainforest biome in Central and West Africa between 2001 and 2014 began in places that had experienced deforestation about two years prior. They added that zoonotic Ebola outbreaks appeared in areas where human population density was high and where the virus has favorable conditions, but that the relative importance of forest loss is partially independent of these factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first 14 years of the 21st century, an area larger than the size of Bangladesh was felled in the Congo River basin rainforest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations has warned that if the current deforestation and population growth trends continue, the country\\'s rainforest may have completely disappeared by the end of the century. As that happens, animals and the viruses they carry will collide with people in new and often disastrous ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t have to be this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nmultidisciplinary group of scientists based across the US, China, Kenya and Brazil has calculated that a global investment of $30 billion a year into projects to protect rainforests, halt the wildlife trade and farming would be enough to offset the cost of preventing future pandemics.\\r\\n\\r\\nWriting in the journal Science, the group said spending $9.6 billion a year on global forest protection schemes could lead to a 40% reduction in global deforestation in areas at the highest risk of virus spillover. This could include incentivizing the people living in and making their living from the forests, and banning widespread logging and the commercialization of the wildlife trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar program in Brazil led to a 70% decline in deforestation between 2005 and 2012, the scientists said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile $30 billion a year may sound like a lot, scientists argue that the investment would quickly pay for itself. The coronavirus pandemic will cost the US alone an estimated $16 trillion over the next 10 years, according to Harvard economists David Cutler and Larry Summers , the former US Treasury Secretary. The IMF estimates that globally, the pandemic will cost $28 trillion in lost output between 2020 and 2025, relative to pre-pandemic projections.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early warning system\\r\\n\\r\\nMuyembe now runs the INRB in Kinshasa.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some scientists still sit in the cramped offices in the old INRB compound where Muyembe first worked on Ebola, brand-new laboratories opened in February. The INRB is supported by Japan, the US, the World Health Organization, the EU and other international donors including NGOs, foundations and academic institutions\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Biosafety Level 3 labs, genome sequencing capability and world-class equipment, these facilities are not an act of charitable aid -- they\\'re a strategic investment\\r\\n\\r\\nBacked by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, these INRB labs are the world\\'s early warning system for new outbreaks of known diseases like Ebola, and -- perhaps more importantly -- for those illnesses we have yet to discover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If a pathogen emerged from Africa it will take time to spread all over the world,\" Muyembe said. \"So, if this virus is detected early -- like in my institution here -- there will be opportunity for Europe [and the rest of the world] to develop new strategies to fight these new pathogens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMuyembe has reconnaissance units on the frontline of the war against new pathogens. Doctors, virologists and researchers are working deep in the DRC\\'s interior, seeking out known and unknown viruses before they can cause new pandemics.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon Pierre Ndimbo and Guy Midingi are ecologists and virus hunters in the DRC\\'s northwestern Ã\\x89quateur Province, where Ingende is located. They\\'re the tip of the spear in tracking and tracing signs of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a recent expedition the pair collected 84 bats, painstakingly picking them from their nets and tying the squealing, nipping animals up into bags.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have to be careful -- if not, they bite,\" explained Midingi, his hands double-gloved for protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nA single bat bite could be the moment a new disease makes the leap from animals to humans\\r\\n\\r\\nNdimbo says their priority is to look for signs of Ebola infection in the bats. The latest outbreak of the disease in the Ã\\x89quateur province has been traced to human-to-human transmission but also to a new strain that is asumed so have come from the forest reservoir. And no one knows where, or what, that reservoir is.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack at the lab in Mbandaka the bats are swabbed, and blood samples are taken to be tested for Ebola before being sent to the INRB for further tests. The bats are then released.\\r\\n\\r\\nDozens of new coronaviruses have been found in bats over recent years. No one knows just how dangerous they may be to humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a lab in Mbandaka, ecologists prepare to take a blood sample from a bat captured in the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nExactly how Ebola first infected humans remains a mystery, but scientists believe zoonotic illnesses like Ebola and Covid-19 make the leap when wild animals are butchered.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo-called \"bushmeat\" is the traditional source of protein for people living in the rainforests, but it is now traded far from where it\\'s sourced and exported globally. The UN estimates that as much as 5 million tons of bushmeat are taken from the Congo River basin each year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Kinshasa, a market trader brandishes the smoked carcass of a colobus monkey, its teeth exposed in a gruesome, petrified grin -- he\\'s selling the small primates for $22, though the price, he says, is \"negotiable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColobus monkeys have been hunted to extinction in some parts of the DRC, but the trader says he could export scores of them to Europe by plane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have to be honest, it\\'s forbidden to send the monkeys,\" he explains. \"We have to cut their heads and arms off and pack them among the other meats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says he gets deliveries every week, often from Ingende, around 400 miles upriver -- the same village where doctors live in fear of a new pandemic emerging.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdams Cassinga, CEO of Conserv Congo and a wildlife crime investigator, said investigations have shown that \"in Kinshasa alone, we have between five and 15 tons of bushmeat exported ... some goes to the Americas ... but the biggest part goes to Europe. Mainly to Brussels, Paris and London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoked monkeys, soot-blackened sections of python, and fly-blown hams of sitatunga, a water-dwelling antelope, are gruesome. But they\\'re unlikely to be carrying dangerous viruses, which would be killed by the cooking process -- although scientists have warned that even cooked primate meat is not completely safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe live animals in the so-called \"wet\" market pose a bigger threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere young crocodiles -- snouts wired shut and legs tied up -- writhe on top of one another. Traders offer barrels of giant land snails, tortoises and freshwater turtles. Elsewhere there are black markets from live chimpanzees, and more exotic animals, some traded into private collections, others heading for the pot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Disease X\" may be ticking away inside any one of these animals, brought to the metropolis by poor people serving the tastes of the rich for exotic meals and pets.\\r\\n\\r\\nBushmeat market in Kinshasa Port. Smoked fish is for sale here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bushmeat here, in urban areas, unlike the popular misconception, it is not for the poor, it is for the rich and privileged, so you\\'ve got high-ranking officials who believe in superstition that if you consume a certain type of bushmeat, it will give you strength,\" Cassinga said. \"You also have people who consume it as a symbol of status. But also in the last 10 to 20 years we have experienced an influx of expatriates, mainly from Southeast Asia, and who demand to eat certain types of meat such as turtles, snakes, primates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists have previously linked these kinds of wet markets to zoonotic diseases. The H5N1 influenza virus, known as the avian flu, and SARS both emerged from them. The exact origin of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 has not been confirmed. But the greatest suspicion for its source has fallen on \"wet\" markets where live animals are sold and butchered for meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commercialization of the bushmeat trade is a potential route for infection. It\\'s also a symptom of the devastation of the Congo tropical rainforest, the world\\'s second largest after the Amazon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the destruction is driven by local farmers, who rely on the forest economically -- 84% of forest clearance is to make room for small scale agriculture\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the slash and burn techniques used by the locals increase human exposure to this once-virgin territory and its wild animals, a major risk factor for disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you go in the forest ... you will change the ecology; and insects and rats will leave this place and come to the villages ... so this is the transmission of the virus, of the new pathogens,\" Muyembe said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Ingende Hospital, the doctors are wearing as much protective gear as can be found: Goggles, yellow biohazard overalls, double gloves taped shut, hoods over their heads and shoulders, galoshes over their shoes, and complex facemasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are still worried that the female patient may be showing symptoms of an Ebola-like illness that is not, in fact, Ebola. It may be a new virus, it may also be one of the many diseases that afflict people here that are already known to science -- but none of the tests done here have explained her high fever and diarrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We get cases which look very much like Ebola, but then when we do the tests, they are negative,\" said the head of medical services in Ingende, Dr. Christian Bompalanga.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have to carry out additional examinations in order to see what is really going on ... at the moment there are a couple of suspected cases over there,\" he added, pointing to the isolation ward where the young woman and her kids are being treated. And weeks later there remains no clear diagnosis for her illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a new virus begins circulating among humans, the consequences of a brief encounter at the edge of a forest or at a wet market could be devastating. Covid-19 has shown that. Ebola has proved it. And in most of the scientific publications there is an assumption that there will be more contagions coming as humans continue to destroy wilderness habitats. It\\'s not an \"IF\" it\\'s a \"WHEN\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution is clear. Protect the forests to protect humanity -- because Mother Nature has deadly weapons in her armory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story has been updated to include what the \"X\" in \"Disease X\" stands for.',\n",

All opinions expressed in this article belong to Udobang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time my body went viral, it was a photograph I posted on my Instagram. I\\'m wearing a blue swimsuit and I\\'m standing with one hand on my hip striking a pose on the beach in Havana, Cuba. I certainly didn\\'t expect the number of reposts and neither did I expect people commenting in my inbox with words like \"Brave,\" \"Inspiring,\" and \"Confident.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as I was concerned, I was just wearing beach-appropriate clothing while on holiday. Why is it that me documenting these seemingly normal activities conjure such loaded words?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, in fact, my body has always been one of the major narratives in my life. For example, many of the nicknames I was given as a child were related to my fatness, like \"fatty bum bum\" -- said in endearment. My body seems to precede everything else about me -- at least in other people\\'s minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, I have always been aware of its ranking on the beauty and desirability front. In fact, whenever my body is the subject of conversation, someone usually says something about my \"pretty face,\" leading me to believe that I might have had the chance to be beautiful, but because of my body, I did not make the cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe image of Wana Udobang on a beach in Cuba that went viral Credit: courtesy wana udobang\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while self-love has been a necessary part of shaping my own self-perception into something positive, it is not the panacea it is often touted to be. It hasn\\'t quite insulated me from the impact of other people\\'s thoughts about my physical form.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond time around\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second time my body went viral, it was the result of a collaboration between me, Swedish designer Mina Lundgren of Notion of Form, and Nigerian photographer Lakin Ogunbanwo . The project was an exploration of the body as a sculptural form, with photos showing how folds, tan lines and stretch marks can become markers of interest. The result was a series of still images and a short film narrated with poetry that I had written.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem reads: \"You came out of your mother\\'s womb, a sculpture of brittle bones and wrinkled flesh glistening in stardust and magic. You are miracle child, a lineage of women defying the notion of form. You are art, a body gorging with stories of love and loss, off absence and abundance, you are wild, soft and free. This is why they call you beautiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWana Udobang photographed by Lakin Ogunbanwo. Credit: Lakin Ogunbanwo\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reception was overwhelmingly positive, and again my inbox was inundated with messages applauding my bravery, and admiration for my choice to bare my skin, as well as invitations to speak about body politics on Instagram live chats and television shows. And while part of me will remain bewildered by the fact that images of me can illicit such strong responses, it would be disingenuous to pretend that I don\\'t have some idea why.\\r\\n\\r\\nBodies like mine are often deemed undisciplined, lazy, unruly, shameful, lacking in self-control and steeped in low self-esteem, so even any compliments that allude to my level of confidence and assumed boldness are likely to be rooted in bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also why me posting a photo of myself wearing a bathing suit automatically throws my body -- and all of me --into a \"political\" position, it\\'s seen as me making a statement. But it also denies me the privilege of simply being vain, self-indulgent or just showing off my beach body, as smaller women might do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWana Udobang photographed by Lakin Ogunbanwo. Credit: Lakin Ogunbanwo\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right to be there\\r\\n\\r\\nI know firsthand how society\\'s perceptions of what we look like shapes how we see ourselves, and sometimes how we live our lives. Once while auditioning for a television gig some hurtful behind-the-scenes information was leaked to me. During a board meeting someone had objected to my suitability for the role, saying that Nigerians don\\'t like to see fat people on TV. I went through each audition stage with this knowledge hanging over my head -- but I still showed up. I still believed I had the right to be there. I got the job in the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years my strategy has been to be likeable, overly pleasing and easy going. In professional situations I have refused to complain, even when it would have been justifiable for me to do so, afraid that I could be easily replaced, or that the topic of how I look would resurface. I decided that even if I wasn\\'t the kind of person that people wanted to look at, at least I would be a dream to work with.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of conversations about expanding the scope of what we mean by \"beauty,\" and the work of body positivity movements over the years, it is impossible to ignore that how we see others -- and ourselves -- has been shaped by the images that circle around us daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nA portrait of Wana Udobang Credit: courtesy Kamnelechukwu Obasi\\r\\n\\r\\nBecoming a conduit\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the last decade, I have been very lucky to have been involved in making art, and specifically performance, which has given me the means to connect with my body in more than just the obvious ways. From performing on a stage or in front of a camera to collaborating with visual artists, I have been able to see my body as both physical and metaphysical material, form and content, object and subject; a conduit for sharing and channeling creativity -- and not just an end in itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut until people are willing to take responsibility for their own limited views about beauty and what shape a body should be (especially a woman\\'s body), I have settled on coming to terms with the fact that I will continue to oscillate between my own ideas about beauty and my body, and other people\\'s expectations.',\n",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, I decided to treat myself to a pair of Kenyan-made Enda running shoes. I'm no marathon runner, but lockdown has inspired me to up the ante in my exercise regimen, and who better to trust with my feet than Kenya, home of the kings and queens of distance running?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Endas cost 13,000 Kenyan shillings, which is around $117 US â\\x80\\x94 not exactly cheap, but it still undercuts a few big-name competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there was a catch: Delivery service DHL said it could only dispatch the shoes to my home in South Africa if I paid 879 South African rand â\\x80\\x94 around $58 â\\x80\\x94 in import tariffs.

In many ways, it summed up the experience of high costs and logistical challenges that has held back intra-Africa trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 1990, Africa's intra-regional trade languished at around 5% of total African imports, according to the International Monetary Fund.

       " '(CNN) As vaccines start to be administered across the world, the beginning of the end of the pandemic is at last in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut some countries are at risk of missing out. While the African Union has secured 270 million vaccine doses for distribution across the continent, in addition to those promised by the global vaccine program COVAX, this could still fall short of demand for the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if enough vaccines are secured, there is an enormous logistical challenge: how to transport temperature-sensitive vaccines to places without reliable electricity and refrigeration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is in developing a \"cold chain\" -- a network of vehicles, fridges and cold rooms -- that can be used to transport the vaccine seamlessly from the manufacturer to the immunization point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We should have been designing the cold chain the day we started designing a vaccine,\" says Toby Peters, a professor in cold economy at the University of Birmingham, in the UK, who is working with the UN-backed Africa Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Cooling and Cold Chain to improve refrigeration networks in Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We knew we were going to have to move billions of vaccines around the world, all the way out to rural communities, and that we\\'d need a temperature-controlled environment,\" he adds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has to be kept at minus 75 degrees Celsius (minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit,) while Moderna\\'s can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThese temperature requirements will be out of reach for most African countries, says Peters, but options like the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which can be kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), will be more feasible.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven so, existing cold chain networks will not be enough. Without new technology, up to 25% of vaccine supplies could be lost, says Peters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar-powered refrigeration\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are almost 600 million people in Africa living off the grid, and rural clinics often lack a grid connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is where solar energy comes in, says Hugh Whalan, CEO of PEG Africa, a company that offers pay-as-you-go solar-powered products to people in West Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn preparation for a Covid-19 vaccination drive, the company -- with funding from Power Africa, a network of private and public groups set up by USAid -- has started providing solar-power systems to off-grid health clinics.\\r\\n\\r\\nProviding solar power to off-grid clinics enables refrigeration as well as other medical procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fridges need power to run reliably in order to safely store vaccines, or else they will spoil. So we provide the power,\" he tells CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, PEG Africa\\'s refrigeration efforts had focused on establishing a cold chain for food products, helping produce get to market without spoiling. It is currently testing pay-as-you-go solar freezers among fisherwomen in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the pilot finishes in the middle of this year, Whalan hopes to use the same financing and distribution infrastructure to roll out solar-powered fridges and freezers to health clinics and immunization points.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the two fridge suppliers PEG Africa is working with, one has already received performance, quality and safety (PQS) certification from the World Health Organization, and the other is in the process of acquiring it.\\r\\n\\r\\nReaching the last mile\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore a vaccine is administered to someone, it typically has to travel from the manufacturer to an airport, to a national vaccine store, to a provincial vaccine store, to a local health center and, finally, to the end location where it\\'s given to a patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The last mile is the biggest challenge, and it\\'s where there\\'s the biggest gap,\" says Peters.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a highly portable solution, Gricd hopes to distribute vaccines to remote and underserved communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nGricd, a small Nigerian startup, is hoping to help fill this gap. It\\'s building solar-powered cold boxes for vaccine transportation that can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and can be controlled remotely and monitored in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company says it has worked with Nigeria\\'s National Centre for Disease Control and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research during the pandemic, helping to collect and transport Covid-19 test samples from remote areas. It has also secured partnerships with private healthcare companies in South Africa, Ghana and Egypt, says Oghenetega Iortim, the company\\'s founder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boxes range in size from 15 to 100 liters, with the smallest able to transport around 200 doses of vaccine.

Explore the desert through some of North Africa's best hiking trails or take it easy at five star resorts complete with private beaches that slide gently into azure water. Cairo's long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum is scheduled for opening in 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho can go\\r\\n\\r\\nAll travelers can enter Egypt providing they can show proof of a negative Covid-19 test.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the restrictions?\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom September 1, all arrivals into Egypt, including its citizens, must provide a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure. This extends to 96 hours for arrivals from Japan, China, Thailand, North America, South America, Canada, London, Paris, and Frankfurt. The certificate must be written in English and Arabic and be stamped by an accredited laboratory. All travelers must complete a personal monitoring card and show proof of health insurance on arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, those arriving in the coastal governorates of South Sinai, Red Sea and Marsa Matrouh who cannot show evidence of a negative test are able to take a test and then isolate while awaiting the results, at a cost of $30.

As this reversal is set in motion, temperatures across the northern Plains will surge as much as 35 to 45 degrees above the historic lows this past week.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the south, cities such as Houston, which reported snow on its nearby beaches, will also feel signs of warmth as highs climb into the 50\\'s come Saturday, the 60\\'s by Sunday and possibly the 70\\'s by the middle of next week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Climate Prediction Center supports the significant shift towards warmer conditions for large areas of the northern, central and southern Plains that were all impacted by the wintry conditions over the past week. In parts of Oklahoma, where temperatures fell to their lowest in over a century, forecast models suggest highs in places such as Oklahoma City will rebound back to the low 60\\'s beginning next Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the start of spring officially now 30 days away and days increasing in length by roughly 2 to 3 minutes per day, a hint of spring couldn\\'t come at a better time for much of the winter battered nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the Gulf Coast state of Louisiana, where temperatures in the teens were the norm earlier in the week, highs are set to rebound into the mid 60\\'s by Sunday and the mid 70\\'s by the middle of next week. Although the warmth will not be nearly as drastic for parts of the northern Plains and Midwest, temperatures should still climb above average over the next week. Part of the reason the warmth will be kept at bay for these northern areas is the historic amount of snow that has covered many of these areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow acts as a great coolant during the day as its white color reflects solar energy and any warmth off its surface. This limits daytime high temperatures. After sunset, snow continues to cool its surrounding environment, especially if the skies are clear since snow cover is an excellent emitter of long wave radiation. Meaning the areas with mostly snow still on the ground could fail to realize the potential warmth Mother Nature will be serving up next week.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough February looks to end on a milder note for many in the recently impacted regions, it\\'s important to note that several more blasts of arctic air could be expected for the northern Plains, upper Midwest and Northeast, even well into March.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, for the states of Wyoming, North Dakota and Colorado, March is climatologically the snowiest time of year, so a few more blasts of wintry conditions should come as no surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is likelier that the southern Plains and the Gulf Coast states will begin to trend in the direction of noticeable warmth in the coming weeks, and as a result, the gradual uptick in severe weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlooding concerns\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother growing concern over the next few days is river flooding. The bitter cold temperatures from the past week will lead to ice jams. An ice jam occurs when pieces of floating ice build up and block the flow of water in rivers and streams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The main concern with ice jams is flooding,\" said Jennifer Gray, CNN Meteorologist. \"The most common places for ice jams are usually near bridges and sharp turns in rivers. When large chunks of ice flow up against a bridge, that bridge acts like a dam causing the water to back up behind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Weather Service offices in multiple states including Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota are warning about the potential for river flooding this week due to ice jams.\\r\\n\\r\\nA flood advisory is in effect for two counties in eastern Nebraska due to an ongoing ice jam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Minor flooding was occurring and will be possible for at least the next few weeks, the NWS office in Omaha warned. \"Water levels around ice jams are notoriously unpredictable, and can change quickly with little or no warning. Colder than normal temperatures through the next week will create large areas of ice.\"',\n",

       " 'New York (CNN Business) Even mighty Texas, the energy powerhouse of America, is feeling the wrath of Mother Nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nA deep freeze this week in the Lone Star state, which relies on electricity to heat many homes, is causing power demand to skyrocket. At the same time, natural gas, coal, wind and nuclear facilities in Texas have been knocked offline by the unthinkably low temperatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis situation could have wide-reaching implications as the US power industry attempts to slash carbon emissions in response to the climate crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat nightmarish supply-demand situation has sent electricity prices in energy-rich Texas to skyrocket more than 10,000% compared with before the unprecedented temperatures hit. Texas has been hit with life-threatening blackouts. More than 4 million people in the state were without power early Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, Governor Greg Abbott has called for an investigation into the nonprofit Electric Reliability Council of Texas, known as ERCOT, which controls most of the state\\'s grid. The group\\'s CEO on Tuesday defended the controlled outages, saying they \"kept the grid from collapsing\" and sending the state into a complete blackout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Not designed to handle these unusual conditions\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some are attempting to pin the blame on one fuel source or another, the reality is that the Arctic temperatures are hobbling fossil fuels and renewable energy alike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The extreme cold is causing the entire system to freeze up,\" said Jason Bordoff, a former energy official in the Obama administration and director of Columbia University\\'s Center on Global Energy Policy. \"All sources of energy are underperforming in the extreme cold because they\\'re not designed to handle these unusual conditions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ripple effects are being felt around the nation as Texas\\' prolific oil-and-gas industry stumbles.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotiva\\'s sprawling Port Arthur oil refinery, the largest in the United States , shut down Monday, citing \"unprecedented freezing temperatures.\" About 2.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity was shut between Houston and Louisiana, according to Rystad Energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrices at the pump are also on the rise. The national average could easily rise 15 cents per gallon over the next week or two, according to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas is No. 1 in natural gas, oil and wind\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s striking that these power outages are happening in a state with abundant energy resources. Texas produces more electricity than any other US state â\\x80\\x94 generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas is the No. 1 US state in both crude oil and natural gas, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The state accounted for a staggering 41% of America\\'s oil production in 2019 and a quarter of its marketed natural gas output.\\r\\n\\r\\nWind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019, the EIA said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the problem is that not only is Texas an energy superpower, it tends to be an above-average temperature state. That means its infrastructure is ill-prepared for the cold spell currently wreaking havoc. And the consequences are being felt by millions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not just wind power\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics of renewable energy have pointed out that wind turbines have frozen or needed to be shut down due to the extreme weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is significant because almost a quarter (23%) of the power in Texas last year was generated by wind power, according to ERCOT.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though other places with colder weather (like Iowa and Denmark) rely on wind for even larger shares of power, experts said the turbines in Texas were not winterized for the unexpected freeze. Cold weather protection like antifreeze and heating elements within the turbine blades and components are not commonly used in Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That adds cost, so it is cheaper to not have those additional features,\" said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton University who studies energy systems and policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not just about wind turbines going down. Natural gas and coal-fired power plants need water to stay online. Yet those water facilities froze in the cold temperatures and others lost access to the electricity they require to operate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ability of some companies that generate the power has been frozen. This includes the natural gas & coal generators,\" Governor Abbott wrote on Twitter\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\\'s an even bigger deal to Texas than frozen wind turbines because combined cycle natural gas (40%) and coal (18%) generated more than half of the state\\'s power in 2020, according to ERCOT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Power prices going to the moon\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nNuclear also depends on water to operate and at least one unit in South Texas shut down, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . Texas gets about 11% of its power from nuclear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even if Texas did not have wind power, you would still have power prices going to the moon,\" said Matthew Hoza, manager of energy analysis at BTU Analytics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem, according to Hoza, is that a lot of companies in Texas did not invest in cold protection for power plants and natural gas facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you\\'re in West Texas, are you really going to spend money on that equipment?\" Hoza said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsolated from the national grid\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s too early to definitively say what went wrong in Texas and how to prevent similar outages. More information will need to be released by state authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, some experts say the criticism of wind power appears overdone already.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In terms of the blame game, the focus on wind is a red herring. It\\'s more of a political issue than what is causing the power problems on the grid,\" said Dan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.\\r\\n\\r\\nCohan said there was a far greater shortfall in terms of the amount of power Texas was expecting from natural gas than wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s clear that a wide range of energy sources â\\x80\\x94 from fossil fuels to renewables â\\x80\\x94 were not prepared for the unusual weather in Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Regions need to rethink the extreme conditions to which they\\'re planning for and to make sure their systems are designed to be resilient to those,\" said Princeton\\'s Jenkins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe energy crisis in Texas raises also questions about the nature of the state\\'s deregulated and decentralized electric grid. Unlike other states, Texas has made a conscious decision to isolate its grid from the rest of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat means that when things are running smoothly, Texas can\\'t export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current crisis, it can\\'t import power either.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas,\" Cohan said. \"That has really come back to bite us.\"',\n",

       " '(CNN) Wildfires and hurricane-force winds produce stunning videos and headlines, but flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd almost no place in the country is immune as 98% of all counties in the US have experienced at least one flooding event. In the last decade alone, floods have caused more than $155 billion worth of damage , according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the climate changes, the risk of financial loss from flooding for millions of homeowners is increasing\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, there are nearly 4.3 million residential properties around the country with a substantial risk of financial loss due to flooding. The report defines \"substantial risk\" as carrying a 1% chance of flooding in any year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome, but not all, of those homeowners have insurance through the federal government\\'s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides more than 90% of the flood insurance policies in the US\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the report finds that those homes face losses each year which dwarf the costs of their NFIP premiums. The average NFIP premium cost today for those properties is around $981 , but their expected annual loses are $4,694 per property.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all of those property owners were to purchase flood insurance to protect against potential damage, premiums would need to increase by 4.5 times to cover the risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe analysis was conducted by the First Street Foundation , a non-profit research and technology group that aims to shed light on the growing risk of flooding around the country due to climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study only considered residential properties with between one and four units, but the authors say the actual financial risk from flooding around the country is likely far greater than the report captures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our numbers are large ... but it\\'s not encompassing all properties that are inside the Special Flood Hazard Area, or many other residential properties like condos, apartment buildings and other larger buildings,\" said Matthew Eby, founder and executive director of the First Street Foundation. \"So if you take that and you extrapolate, there are actually a lot more buildings that have financial risk as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nseparate report from the foundation last year estimated that there are a total of 14.6 million properties around the country with substantial flood risk. The owners of around 5.9 million of those properties may be unaware of their flood risk because they are located outside of FEMA\\'s Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), and therefore aren\\'t required to buy flood insurance even if they hold a government-backed mortgage loan, the report found.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the 4.3 million homes with a 1% chance of flooding carry an expected annual loss of $20.8 billion due to flood damage, the foundation\\'s analysis found.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, within the life of a 30-year mortgage signed today, those losses are projected to balloon by 61% to nearly $32.2 billion per year by 2050 due to the effects of climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs massive storms like Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey and Sandy have hammered some of the country\\'s biggest coastal cities, the NFIP\\'s bottom line has already taken a beating.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the program is saddled with more than $20.5 billion in debt, according to a recent Congressional Review Service Report . That\\'s after Congress canceled $16 billion of the NFIP\\'s debt in 2017 to allow the program to pay claims to victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With climate change and more development and more properties at risk, it just keeps going further in the hole,\" said Sandra Knight, a senior research engineer at the University of Maryland\\'s Center for Disaster Resilience and a former FEMA administrator. \"That tells you you\\'re not collecting enough premiums, but the long-term game is to have zoning and building codes that minimize risk. You can\\'t just depend on insurance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts and even FEMA officials have acknowledged for years that there are shortcomings with the NFIP as it is currently structured.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among those is the process of drawing FEMA\\'s flood maps, which provide the basis for setting insurance rates for many policies under the NFIP.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though FEMA maps are required by Congress to be reassessed every five years, Grimm says it takes seven years on average to complete a new flood map , meaning that some maps may technically be out of date by the time they\\'re finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn emergency worker helps evacuate people stranded by flooding during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. A new report finds that the risk of financial loss for homeowners due to flooding is expected to grow as the climate changes\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance rate setting under the NFIP has seen little change since the 1970s\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rates are set depending on which of three broad types of flood zones a property sits in : low to moderate risk, high risk or high risk coastal area. The type of property, the elevation of the building, the number of floors and whether it has a basement are also factored in.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut experts say the use of these flood zones is an unsophisticated way to gauge risk that doesn\\'t take into account key considerations, like the topography of the land where a property sits. FEMA\\'s flood models only factor in the risk of storm surge and river flooding , not the threat posed by heavy rainfall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s actually sort of a crude way to price flood risk because it doesn\\'t account for changing flood risk across a landscape,\" said Carolyn Kousky, the executive director of the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the advisory board for the First Street Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address these problems, FEMA is expected to roll out a new system for setting flood insurance rates later this year called Risk Rating 2.0 , which the agency says will utilize the latest technology to better capture the risk for each individual property.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Maurstad, the senior executive of the National Flood Insurance Program, said that the First Street Foundation\\'s findings should not be taken as a preview of the rate changes flood insurance policy holders can expect when Risk Rating 2.0 goes into effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Any attempt to compare an outside entity\\'s premium estimates or premium recommendations to the Risk Rating 2.0 initiative is premature,\" Maurstad said in an emailed statement. \"FEMA is constantly working to leverage new technologies and provide national-scale flood risk information more efficiently, accurately and consistently to the public.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Kousky says that the new findings are an important indicator of just how much the cost of flood damage could grow around the country as the climate changes, which the cost of insurance in any single year does not capture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly has shown how much flood losses are going to start increasing as a result of climate change,\" she said. \"That should be a red flag for the NFIP and communities everywhere that the cost of this risk are going up.

The names of the most damaging ones live on because of the devastation they left in their wake.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when storm surge strikes a developed coastline, the cost in both lives and property can be enormous.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a stormâ\\x80\\x99s winds blow onshore, they can send feet of water rushing inland at depths far greater than even the most extreme high tides.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorm surge is the rapid rise in ocean levels brought about by the powerful winds and low pressure in a hurricane.\\r\\n\\r\\nHurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds, but the most deadly and destructive threat posed by most hurricanes is the storm surge they can produce .\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat scientists know for sure\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready, storm surge has gotten worse because sea levels are rising - and fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland storm surge can travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the height of Hurricane Dorian , Michael Pintard, Bahamasâ\\x80\\x99 Minister of Agriculture, recorded this video from the second story of his house. Water is seen lapping against the windows, which he estimates in the video to be nearly 20 feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile no tide gauge measurements were available in the hardest-hit parts of the Bahamas when Hurricane Dorian struck in 2019, witnesses reported that the storm put parts of the islands under as much as 20 feet of water .\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists now say sea levels could rise by more than three feet by 2100.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs sea levels continue to rise this century, the storm surge risk to the city will also grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere's what 2 feet of sea level rise would look like.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with 1 foot of sea level rise, parts of it would be underwater.\\r\\n\\r\\nLow-lying cities like Charleston, South Carolina, are already vulnerable to storm surge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there have been several recent storms that provide anecdotal evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut because observation stations that monitor rainfall are sparse and hurricane satellite data only goes back a few decades, we canâ\\x80\\x99t yet draw conclusions about how much climate change has affected rainfall, said Kossin.\\r\\n\\r\\nComputer models consistently show that hurricane rainfall is increasing already, as one would expect as the planet warms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat would mean that in a world warmed by two degrees Celsius, you would have, on average, around 14% more water vapor in the atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSimply put, warmer air holds more water vapor,â\\x80\\x9d said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist at NOAAâ\\x80\\x99s National Center for Environmental Information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increase in hurricane rainfall can be explained by physics â\\x80\\x94 specifically, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which holds that for each degree Celsius of warming, 7% more water vapor should be available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Southeastern US alone, the annual cost of storm surge damage is projected to grow to $56 billion by 2050 , according to the US governmentâ\\x80\\x99s 2018 National Climate Assessment. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s even if global emissions of heat-trapping gases are moderately curbed in the next two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally speaking, a rise in sea levels of 2 to 3 feet would mean that a Category 1 hurricane could be capable of inflicting the kind of storm surge damage we would expect today from a Category 2 storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf humans continue to emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, scientists expect that sea levels will climb even higher , putting major cities at an even greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is making the storms more dangerous as it leads to higher inundation levels,â\\x80\\x9d said Tom Knutson, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who leads the agencyâ\\x80\\x99s weather and climate dynamics division.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as â\\x80\\x98floodedâ\\x80\\x99 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as â\\x80\\x98floodedâ\\x80\\x99 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as â\\x80\\x98floodedâ\\x80\\x99 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as â\\x80\\x98floodedâ\\x80\\x99 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as â\\x80\\x98floodedâ\\x80\\x99 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis added heat is likely allowing hurricanes to pack even greater wind speeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat scientists think they know\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following year, Hurricane Florence swamped parts of North Carolina with nearly three feet of rain , shattering the stateâ\\x80\\x99s previous record for tropical storm rainfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmount of heat in the upper layer of the ocean, compared to the average from 1955-2006.

Because of this, scientists say more data is needed before we can say with certainty how climate change will impact hurricanesâ\\x80\\x99 strength now and in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlmost all of the damage and mortality caused by hurricanes is done by major hurricanes (Category 3 to 5),â\\x80\\x9d Kossin said. â\\x80\\x9cIncreasing the likelihood of having a major hurricane will certainly increase this risk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith stronger storms, thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a greater chance for severe damage and destruction when hurricanes collide with towns and cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe prevailing consensus is that we likely wonâ\\x80\\x99t see more storms in the future (maybe even fewer), but that these storms may be stronger,â\\x80\\x9d Klotzbach said. â\\x80\\x9cIf you look at the (hurricane) trend since 1980 (when reliable data became available), thereâ\\x80\\x99s a huge increasing trend in Category 4s and 5s.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPhil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University who monitors and analyzes hurricane trends across the globe, draws similar conclusions about how climate change is increasing hurricanesâ\\x80\\x99 strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe change is about 8% per decade,â\\x80\\x9d Kossin said. â\\x80\\x9cIn other words, during its lifetime, a hurricane is 8% more likely to be a major hurricane in this decade compared to the last decade.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a study released earlier this year examining nearly 40 years of available satellite data , Kossin and his co-authors found that the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status (Category 3 or above with winds in excess of 110 mph or higher), increased decade after decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe stronger storms are getting stronger,â\\x80\\x9d he warned, â\\x80\\x9cand the stronger storms are becoming more frequent.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut that is not what is really important,â\\x80\\x9d Kossin said. The added heat in the oceans is â\\x80\\x9cincreasing the speed limit for storms,â\\x80\\x9d raising the maximum intensity that storms can achieve.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have relatively high confidence that storms will get stronger,â\\x80\\x9d said Kossin. Both he and Knutson estimated the increase in the wind speeds to be between about 3% and 4% per degree Celsius of warming.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some recent research has shown this trend, scientists say not enough historical data exists to say how much more common rapid intensification has become.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in November, Hurricanes Eta and Iota both rapidly gained strength before making landfall in Central America just weeks apart, with Iota becoming the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua . The fact that there were water temperatures warm enough to allow both storms to rapidly intensify this late in the season is a clear signal of global warming, Klotzbach said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree of the most damaging hurricanes to strike the US in 2020 â\\x80\\x94 Hanna, Laura and Sally â\\x80\\x94 all rapidly intensified before making landfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom satellite imagery, you can see how Michaelâ\\x80\\x99s eye quickly became more defined and organized as it approached the coast, a sign that the storm was gaining strength:\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this extra heat gives hurricanes more fuel to gain strength rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the planet has warmed, heat in the ocean now extends further below the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nWind and rain churn up the ocean below a hurricane, causing cooler waters from the depths to mix with warmer, surface water. This tends to limit how much a storm can strengthen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHurricanes are fueled by heat energy from warm ocean waters. As a storm moves over the ocean, it pulls in energy from the water's surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe tropics are expanding â\\x80\\x94 so it seems to reason that the tropical cyclones would be able to extend further into the mid-latitudes,â\\x80\\x9d Kossin said, â\\x80\\x9cand when we looked at the data were able to see this shift.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Kossin, who has published multiple studies on the topic, there is a growing body of evidence that there â\\x80\\x9chas been a systematic shift in the storm track that is not easily explained by natural causes.â\\x80\\x9d In the Northern Hemisphere, this means storms are tracking further north and in the Southern Hemisphere, further south.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough scientists say more evidence is needed, some findings in recent years show that more storms are reaching their peak intensities closer to the poles, potentially putting more cities within range of a major hurricane landfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn identical storm will produce much more destruction if it makes landfall in a major coastal city in the mid-latitudes â\\x80\\x93 say New York, Shanghai or Brisbane â\\x80\\x94 than if it slams into a sparsely populated coastline elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo borrow a real estate adage, itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9clocation, location, locationâ\\x80\\x9d that also determines just how much damage a hurricane or typhoon can inflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat scientists are just starting to learn\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe used to observe storms less frequently and with satellites that had lower resolution, and consequently, we likely couldnâ\\x80\\x99t measure rapid intensification as well as we can now,â\\x80\\x9d Klotzbach told CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\nKlotzbach also noted that while the data shows an increase in the number of storms that have rapidly intensified, it also shows an increasing number of storms have rapidly weakened â\\x80\\x94 indicating the increases could also be a function of advances in the amount and quality of data we are now able to collect on storms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis shift in where storms strike could have an even larger impact on the threats hurricanes pose than increases in storm intensity due to climate change, Kossin said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor cities that do not have a history of dealing with tropical storms, especially at or near peak intensity, could be seeing them on a more regular basis in future decades, Kossin said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeavily populated shorelines in northeastern China and Japan are seeing storms with 2 to 3 times the frequency they were in earlier decades, while low-lying archipelagos like the Philippines are seeing storms less frequently than weâ\\x80\\x99d expect, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one place where hurricane tracking data hasnâ\\x80\\x99t shown much of a northward shift is in the Atlantic Basin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scientists, Kossin included, attribute this to some longer-term variabilities that are both natural and human caused. Kossin believes the Atlantic will likely see this poleward shift in the track of storms too, but so far, it has not materialized.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore storms are stalling. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a big problem\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slower a storm moves, the more time its winds and rain can inflict damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019, Hurricane Dorianâ\\x80\\x99s devastating crawl across the Bahamas slowed to 1 mph, slower than the speed at which most humans walk. The slowdown kept the island of Grand Bahama in Dorianâ\\x80\\x99s eye for more than nine hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lashing winds and torrential downpours from Hurricanes Harvey and Florence also slowed to a crawl on land.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the planet warms, scientists say more and more storms appear to be experiencing this slowdown, increasing the amount of time locations in their path are exposed to dangerous conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1944 and 2017, 66 storms have stalled in the north Atlantic Basin, and nearly two-thirds of those occurred within the final 25 years of the study, suggesting a trend towards slower-moving storms, according to a 2019 study from Kossin and co-author Timothy Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the phenomenon isnâ\\x80\\x99t just confined to the Atlantic Basin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis 2018 study in the scientific journal Nature found that the forward speed of hurricanes decreased by 10% globally between 1949 and 2016, though there is some variation in different ocean basins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study also found a 20% to 30% slowdown over land areas affected by North Atlantic and North Pacific tropical cyclones, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe western north Pacific Basin, which sees the most storms annually, has also seen the most slowing, while storms in the northern Indian Ocean do not appear to be slowing down yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, tropical cyclones have slowed more in the Northern Hemisphere, which is where a majority of storms occur each year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is considerable evidence that global summertime circulation patterns in the atmosphere are slowing as a result of global warming. Kossin believes this may also be putting the brakes on hurricane movement, but cautioned that the connection between climate and stalling is still unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome scientists think other variables may be at play.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther natural climate variations â\\x80\\x94 such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation â\\x80\\x93 can also influence hurricane formation over long periods of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis study did not account for these natural cycles, which could be behind much of the observed trend, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\",\n",

She lays out the story in an opening narration, in which dragons fought off a threat 500 years earlier to the mythical kingdom of Kumandra, which subsequently split into five distinct lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaya\\'s father (Daniel Dae Kim) remained in possession of a gem that held the last vestiges of the dragons\\' magic, and dreamed of reuniting the kingdom.

       " '(CNN) \"Coming 2 America\" was clearly designed to be crowd-pleasing back when crowds were possible, and as such it\\'s among the few movies redirected from theaters to streaming that have genuinely lost something because of it. That said, it\\'s still a good deal of fun, reassembling old faces from the 1988 original while adding plenty of new ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first movie came at the height of Eddie Murphy\\'s rise to box-office stardom, after a string of hits in the 1980s. The new film follows a rousing comeback with \"Dolemite is My Name\" and his triumphant Emmy-winning return to \"Saturday Night Live,\" with more nostalgia -- including plans for another \"Beverly Hills Cop\" sequel -- yet to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its core, \"Coming to America\" presented a simple and sweet fairy tale, about a pampered prince traveling to Queens in search of true love. Yet the movie spent much of its time simply serving as a zany showcase for Murphy and Arsenio Hall, spending ample time in the makeup chair for their barber-shop characters and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by \"Dolemite\\'s\" Craig Brewer, \"Coming 2\" reprises all of that, with a nicely cast next-generation element that essentially replays the plot from a different angle. As a bonus, the story (credited to a trio of writers) comes with a feminist hook, and a lesson, like the first film, about setting aside outdated traditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-ish years later, Murphy\\'s Prince Akeem is still happily married to Lisa (Shari Headley) with three talented daughters, the eldest of whom ( \"If Beale Street Could Talk\\'s\" KiKi Layne) would seemingly make a perfect queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead More',\n",

Stick with it, though, and the Hulu movie sort of grows on you, mindless fun that finds the comic absurdities in its protagonist\\'s highly repetitive plight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supporting cast, frankly, feels like something of a distraction. The controversial Mel Gibson plays the main bad guy, a pretty stock character, while Naomi Watts parachutes in as the hero\\'s ex, a scientist who has placed him in the time loop, hoping his special-forces skills will help him find a way to navigate through the dense web of trained assassins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs directed and co-written by Joe Carnahan (who worked with Grillo on \"The Grey\"), what makes \"Boss Level\" more than tolerable is the way Grillo\\'s Roy Pulver learns things the hard way, dying in one version of events before coming back and figuring out a way to survive the next encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Roy puts it in the heavy narration, he\\'s stuck \"in the death loop of a never-ending day,\" and \"Yesterday was months ago.\" If you recall Bill Murray memorizing a French poem to impress someone -- or more recently, anything about \"Palm Springs,\" giving Hulu a time-loop double feature -- imagine applying that discipline to battling a ridiculously skilled sword-wielding attacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, that usually just means dying again (and again), but in this construction, you can\\'t make an omelet without breaking several dozen eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead More',\n",

       " '(CNN) Hits are elusive in the entertainment industry, and the fact Disney+ has conjured two with \"The Mandalorian\" and now \"WandaVision\" speaks to a certain kind of Disney magic. Yet as the latter prepares to end its run, lessons have emerged about translating \"Star Wars\" and Marvel into this relatively new medium, as well as the spells they have cast for Disney+.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most obvious and perhaps least surprising observation is that those brands have an extraordinary amount of equity in them, giving Disney a considerable edge in a streaming environment where having assets that audiences will pay to see -- not just once, but week after week -- represents the ultimate weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney+ has ridden those titles to reaching 95 million subscribers much faster than anyone predicted, by the latest accounting, including the company itself. While the vast Disney library (grown vaster with its acquisition of Fox entertainment content two years ago) is a vital component in that, originals play a central role in helping promote these services and keep them top of mind with the public as well as the media.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few more clear takeaways have emerged from these twin tentpoles, with another high-profile Marvel series, \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" slated to pick up the baton and continue running (or flying) with it on March 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeekly scheduling creates more bang for programming bucks.

       " '(CNN) Depending on one\\'s point of view, we are either living through a golden age of angst-ridden teen dramas, or a glut that risks rendering them indistinguishable from each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the heels of Netflix\\'s \"13 Reasons Why\" and HBO\\'s \"Euphoria\" -- both extraordinarily bleak, raw looks at modern teenage life -- comes two more similarly themed projects: \"Moxie,\" a Netflix movie directed by Amy Poehler (who co-stars as the main character\\'s mom); and \"Genera+ion,\" an HBO Max series created by 19-year-old Zelda Barnz working with her fathers, the married producing team Daniel Barnz and Ben Barnz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Moxie\" is actually based on a book, about a quiet student, Vivian (Hadley Robinson), who finally reacts to injustices at her school by anonymously publishing a pamphlet detailing outrages on behalf of the female student body.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by \"Girls\\'\" Lena Dunham, \"Genera+ion\" focuses on a group of kids framed by the device of an unexpected crisis in a mall bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the other shows, there are common threads to these latest efforts. A frankness about sexuality and drug use, inclusiveness in the casting, and a view of parents as mostly ineffectual and out of touch, at least initially -- not quite Charlie Brown cartoon territory, but not too far away either.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most of the shows, the teens are played by actors in their 20s -- mostly due to convenience (working with minors creates certain logistical restrictions), but a decision that subtly affects the depictions of sex, since the minors are actually adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of \"Genera+ion,\" for example, Justice Smith plays Chester, an out and proud water-polo star who keeps running afoul of the school\\'s dress code, continuously flirts with his adult guidance counselor (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m, like, a lot,\" Chester says early on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of these shows are \"a lot,\" which is of course the point -- conjuring old-fashioned soap operas around younger, more diverse characters, building on what was considered edgy back when \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" or \"Dawson\\'s Creek\" were all the rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustice Smith in the HBO Max series \\'Genera+ion\\' (Photograph by Jennifer Clasen / HBO Max).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continuum rolled on, with controversial movies like director Larry Clark\\'s \"Kids\" and series like \"Skins,\" each seemingly pushing the parameters of teen content a little further, as happens with all genres.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s changed are both the platforms with the advent of streaming and the relaxation of content restrictions. In \"Genera+ion,\" sending a naked photo is not only a dramatic device, but the image of the body part can be shown in vivid color.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that sense, these programs have more in common with independent films than the series of old -- the difference being that instead of telling coming-of-age stories with a beginning, middle and end, as with acclaimed recent examples like \"Lady Bird\" and \"Booksmart,\" the narrative is prolonged in serialized form, upping the ante on situations characters face along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike those films, \"Moxie\" -- described as a \"coming of rage\" story, because of the protagonist\\'s awakening to her school\\'s injustices -- is directed by an actor and possesses some of that irreverent flavor. Late twists ratchet up the drama, but also make the movie feel as it has rushed toward a resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Netflix and HBO have found a fertile audience for teen sagas, every week seems to bring a new independent movie about that demographic, the latest being \"Sophie Jones,\" which looks at a 16-year-old girl dealing with grief -- in part through various sexual encounters -- after her mother\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen \"Euphoria\" premiered, the Washington Post\\'s Bethonie Butler noted that the audience for such shows isn\\'t confined to teens. Referring to another pioneer among high-school-set series, \"Degrassi,\" Butler wrote that while the ad line for that show was \"It goes there,\" \"If \\'Degrassi\\' went there because it had to, \\'Euphoria\\' goes there (and there and, OMG, there) because it can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of \"13 Reasons Why,\" \"going there\" led to excess and a creative slide. Time will tell how well \"Euphoria\" or \"Genera+ion\" deal with those challenges, but as these stories become edgier, standing out from the crowd doesn\\'t get any easier. The one certainty, at this point, is that each generation will have its chance to add to, if not reinvent, the teen-troubles genre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Moxie\" premieres March 3 on Netflix. \"Genera+ion\" premieres March 11 on HBO Max, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.',\n",

       " '(CNN) The less you know about \"Behind Her Eyes\" going in the better, and while the Netflix drama feels slow-going at first, patience has its rewards. By the time it\\'s over, this sci-fi-tinged limited series becomes a buzzworthy binge, one that will likely have you thinking back to clues you might have missed along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially this six-episode British production comes across as just another soap, placing its central figure, Louise (Simona Brown), in an extremely uncomfortable position. A divorced mom, when her plans for a rare night out fizzle she somewhat impulsively ends up flirting with a married man, David (Tom Bateman). Not the best judgment, perhaps, but no real harm done.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, David turns out to be her new boss in the psychiatrist\\'s office where she works, and the tension between them only grows. Moreover, Louise gradually befriends David\\'s seemingly perfect wife, Adele (Eve Hewson), which raises questions about what soured their relationship, and a troubled history that dribbles out (too slowly in the first few episodes) via a series of teasing flashbacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnswers await, however, and as adapted from Sarah Pinborough\\'s book, they prove far more interesting and unexpected than the familiar set-up suggests. What looks like a tale of infidelity with a sort-of reverse \"Fatal Attraction\" vibe -- it\\'s the wife who might be the stalker -- takes off in unanticipated directions and yields genuine surprises. Plus, there\\'s the mystery about Adele\\'s days in a mental-health facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranted, one could argue the shift in tone comes a bit out of left field, but therein lies the fun of it. The performances, thankfully, help get through the rough patches (or should), with Brown as an everywoman in a strange predicament -- bonding with Adele, but drawn to David -- and Bateman\\'s brooding intensity resembling a modern-day version of a character from a Jane Austen novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead More',\n",

Back then the silicon-based panels were hugely expensive and converted just 6% of sunlight into electricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, costs have come down dramatically and today\\'s silicon solar cells can turn up to 22% of sunlight into power. But they\\'re nearly maxed out in terms of efficiency. Now, perovskites offer the potential for dramatic increases in power output, and they could ultimately replace silicon altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers at Oxford PV , a company spun out of the University of Oxford, made a major breakthrough in 2018. By coating silicon with perovskite they achieved 28% efficiency . The company believes it can eventually reach 40%, or higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nImproved solar cell efficiency will enable installations to pump out more power with fewer panels, reducing costs, and the amount of land, labor and equipment needed to operate them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we want to make it that all new power generation is solar photovoltaics, then we need to keep driving the price down,\" Henry Snaith, professor of physics at the University of Oxford and co-founder of Oxford PV, tells CNN Business. \"One way to do that is to keep pushing the efficiency or the power output of the module up, and this is where perovskites really come into play.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar potential\\r\\n\\r\\nPerovskite was discovered in 1839.

But architects are already imagining what a Martian city might look like -- and planning to recreate it in the desert outside Dubai.\\r\\n\\r\\nMars Science City was originally earmarked to cover 176,000 square meters of desert -- the size of more than 30 football fields -- and cost approximately $135 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntended as a space for Dubai\\'s Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) to develop the technology needed to colonize Mars, architects Bjarke Ingels Group were asked to design a prototype of a city suitable for sustaining life on Mars -- and then adapt it for use in the Emirati desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to build a Martian city\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this unique commission, the architects first had to overcome the immense challenges of creating a design to make the inhospitable environment of Mars habitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMars has a thin atmosphere and no global magnetic field, so there\\'s little protection from harmful radiation. Temperature is another problem -- the average on Mars is a chilly -63 degrees C (-81 degrees F). The thin atmosphere also means there\\'s little air pressure, so liquids quickly evaporate into gas; despite freezing temperatures, an unprotected human\\'s blood would boil on Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut according to Jonathan Eastwood, director of the Space Lab at Imperial College London, who\\'s not connected with the Dubai project, the challenges of living on Mars extend far beyond technicalities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think the biggest challenge in terms of a sustained presence on Mars is not the engineering [or scientific] challenge, but the human [and] personal one,\" Eastwood explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So not just to answer the question about how do you survive, but how do you thrive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMartian vernacular architecture\\r\\n\\r\\nHoping his design will allow for the latter, Jakob Lange, partner at Bjarke Ingels Group, explained to CNN how he and his team plan to overcome the challenges posed by the Red Planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo maintain a comfortable temperature and habitable air pressure, the Martian city would be made up of pressurized biodomes each covered with a transparent polyethylene membrane. Oxygen, made by applying electricity to underground ice, would fill each biodome.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside a biodome. Credit: Bjarke Ingels Group\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the population on Mars grows, biodomes would be joined together to form villages and eventually form cities in the shape of rings, or \"toruses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city would be powered and heated using solar energy, and the thin atmosphere could actually help the domes maintain their temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since there is very little atmosphere on Mars, the heat transfer will be very low, meaning that the air inside the domes will not cool down as fast as it would on Earth,\" said Lange.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuildings would be 3D printed under the domes, using Martian soil, and rooms would extend 20 feet underground, protecting from harmful radiation and meteors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unearthly design even becomes a little playful in places. \"In the future on Mars, you would have skylights in your underground cave that would be like aquariums, with fish swimming around,\" said Lange. The water-windows would shield the residents from radiation while allowing light to enter the underground rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo longer bound by Earth\\'s physics, Martian architecture can take on a whole new form.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is approximately one-third gravity which means that you can suddenly make columns that are [slimmer] and [have] longer spans of structures,\" Lange said. \"It creates almost like a completely new rule set that you have to follow when designing architecture in space.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Eastwood, the design meets the challenges posed by Mars. \"I think [these design elements] definitely [are] part of the key infrastructure for a long-term presence,\" he said. \"The idea of gradually shielding [from radiation] is sensible [...] The idea of water windows is quite elegant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMBRSC says the Science City is still in the concept stage, and that it hasn\\'t yet settled on a design or architect for the final build, but BIG has already worked out how it would adapt its proposal for the Dubai desert, if selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Earth, domes wouldn\\'t need to be pressurized or filled with oxygen, and buildings would be 3D-printed from desert sand rather than Martian soil. But the water skylights would still be present, and it would also be powered by solar energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn BIG\\'s design, as well as research labs, Mars Science City will contain an educational facility, museum, an amphitheater, and co-working office space.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet, there\\'s no timeline for when construction will begin, or when it will open, but MBRSC says it is currently conducting a detailed study of the specifications, which it will use to develop a revised budget and size for the site.\\r\\n\\r\\nDreaming of Mars\\r\\n\\r\\nMars Science City is only one part of the ambitious space program run by Dubai\\'s Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. Last year it sent its first astronaut into space ; this summer it will launch a probe to Mars , and in November it will undertake its first-ever analog mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight-month venture will take place in Russia and one Emirati crewmember will be chosen as part of an international team of six. The mission will test the effects of isolation and confinement on mental and physical health.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther places on Earth used to mimic conditions for space missions include Antarctica\\'s Concordia Station, used to simulate isolation, California\\'s Mojave Desert, which NASA has used to test Mars rovers, and the Moroccan Sahara, used by the European Space Agency as a Mars analog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MBRSC hopes that, in future, such research could take place in Mars Science City.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is going to be our platform where we can develop the science [and] the technology that will help us in our future missions to Mars,\" said Adnan AlRais, Mars 2117 Program Manager at MBRSC. \"We want to come up with a totally new facility that will help the international community.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo reach its goal of colonization in less than a century, the MBRSC acknowledges enthusiasm for space travel will have to pass down multiple generations. It hopes Mars Science City will inspire the next generation to dream of life on the Red Planet enough to make it a reality.',\n",
       " 'Written by Rebecca Cairns, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a history spanning millennia across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, henna is steeped in tradition and cultural rituals. The natural dye is typically used to create temporary, intricate body art for religious festivals and celebrations, such as weddings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Dubai-based designer Azra Khamissa is on a mission to give the ancient practice a modern makeover.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pioneer of striking minimalist designs, Khamissa has built a following of more than 100,000 on Instagram , and her creative ideas have led to brand collaborations with fashion houses including Gucci and Fendi.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aim is to create henna designs that align with fashion trends, along with henna products that can be sold through major cosmetics retailers. Khamissa would like to see henna worn all the time -- not just on special occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nKhamissa\\'s minimalist designs include line drawings of faces, flowers and landscapes. Credit: Abdulla El Maz\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ancient art\\r\\n\\r\\nHenna is made from plant leaves. Its origins as a cosmetic product are unknown, but it has \"been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes\" including coloring hair and nails, and decorating hands and feet, says Ade Solihat, a lecturer and researcher of Arab Studies at Universitas Indonesia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Khamissa\\'s childhood, henna was often used for family celebrations like Eid, she says. But as she got older and developed her sense of style, she would \"dread\" occasions where she had to adorn herself with flowery designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nKhamissa\\'s attitude to henna started to change at a friend\\'s wedding in 2017. Preparing for the ceremony, she experimented by decorating the center of her palm with a disc (a design called rubeya, in Arabic) and coloring her fingertips (rawayeb, in Arabic). Usually \"only grandmothers\" would wear this design, says Khamissa, but its simple, bold minimalism appealed to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week later, Khamissa attended a photoshoot for her eponymous handbag brand, where the photographer captured her henna-covered hands. When Khamissa saw the images, she began to see henna in \"a different light.\" Subseqently, she launched her career as a henna artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nDubai-based Azra Khamissa wants to make henna an element of everyday fashion. Credit: Aqib Anwar\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I just kept exploring different traditional designs, and then started adding my own touch to them,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKhamissa tests new designs on her own hands first. When she runs out of space, her sister and grandmother volunteer their hands. Her grandmother isn\\'t always a fan of her modern interpretations -- but when she responds positively, Khamissa knows she\\'s onto a winner: \"Whatever she likes, I know is a great success, because that\\'s the real traditional eye meeting up with something new and different.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMinimalist and modern\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her work, Khamissa reinterprets traditional ornate floral patterns as pared-back line drawings of single flowers, and replaces complex mandalas with simple geometric shapes. Some designs pay homage to traditional North African and Arabic motifs, while others -- topographical outlines, abstract desert landscapes, and politically inspired flags and words -- are her own unique creations.\\r\\n\\r\\nKhamissa says the temporary nature of henna -- which lasts around two weeks -- allows for more \"crazy\" and experimental patterns, like all-over leopard print. For those who don\\'t want to ink themselves permanently, henna offers more flexibility and \"makes tattoo culture a bit more inclusive,\" Khamissa says.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of Khamissa\\'s designs are inspired by nature, including Dubai\\'s desert landscapes. Credit: Azra Khamissa\\r\\n\\r\\nShe isn\\'t alone in taking a modern approach to henna. Fellow UAE-based henna artist Amreen Wahid draws delicate floral designs with a contemporary feel, and beauty bloggers have used henna to create freckles and beauty spots.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolihat, the Arab Studies specialist, says henna is no longer tied to \"symbolic and sacred meanings.\" Modern approaches help it to \"cross borders, ethnicities, and identities,\" she says, adding that it is now popular among demographics without a henna heritage, \"especially among the urban young generation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeauty store henna\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not just Khamissa\\'s designs that are modern -- she wants to update the way henna is sold, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, fresh henna paste, or the raw ingredients to make it, are available only at specialist stores.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a huge gap in the market,\" says Khamissa. \"You can\\'t find henna in a Sephora or Boots, major pharmacies or beauty stores. I want to make it more accessible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKhamissa hopes her designs will inspire people to embrace henna and wear it in a more casual, contemporary way. Credit: Azra Khamissa\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there\\'s a major barrier -- henna paste has a shelf-life of just a few days. Most off-the-shelf henna pastes contain preservatives and some contain PPD (paraphenylenediamine), a synthetic dye that can cause serious allergic reactions\\r\\n\\r\\nA solution to the shelf-life problem would be mini-freezers, which could keep henna paste fresh for up to six months, says Khamissa. She is considering designing her own freezers to allow her to scale up and sell henna in cosmetics stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Khamissa started selling a non-toxic henna kit in May 2020. Other henna specialists, such as Dubai Henna , have established online platforms, reflecting growing demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nKhamissa hopes that by making high-quality henna more accessible, more women will be inspired to get creative with body art in their everyday styling. \"Henna should be like getting your nails done, your hair done, your makeup done for a look. Adding henna just tops it off beautifully.\"',\n",

Credit: Carlos Idun-Tawiah\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter months of research and preparation, he and a team of five Ghanaians came together to create the second installment, titled \" Obaasima ,\" which in the Twi language translates to \"woman of substance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt the need to continue that story in Africa to bring out the history, the real reason why people braid their hair,\" Idun-Tawiah said. \"It\\'s not just for the beauty or aesthetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe style can be traced back some 5,000 years in African culture, according to Ntombomzi Lekgoro, a hairstylist in South Africa. She told CNN that both women and men used to braid their hair -- and it was and still is a big source of pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe braids serve as a a protective style to help with hair growth. Credit: Carlos Idun-Tawiah\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are different reasons why we braid our hair; when I was a kid my mom braided my hair to keep it neat for school, then as a teen I started braiding it for growth purposes and also for trends. ... Now that I\\'m a mom I braid my daughter\\'s hair for growth purposes,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe braiding itself doesn\\'t yield growth; instead, it\\'s the protective nature of the braids that allows for it -- even though the process of getting there involves a lot of tugging and pulling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the salon appointments last several hours, they are social events in and of themselves, an element Idun-Tawiah wanted to capture in his series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photo essay has three parts: picking out a style, the process of the braiding and the ensuing fashion shoot to model off the new look.

       " '(CNN) Niniola Apata, Nigeria\\'s \"Queen of Afro House,\" is a force to be reckoned with. The singer, who gained global attention after her 2017 international hit \"Maradona,\" speaks her mind freely in her music and encourages other women to do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis interview was conducted in August. It has been edited and condensed for clarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNiniola Apata: So first of all, I\\'m a Yoruba girl and there\\'s freedom to express myself as a Yoruba girl -- and because I come from a polygamous family (with) 10 children, (and) I\\'m number six. From when I was little, I was told I have a voice. And so women talk about a lot of things. You talk about your body, you talk about men, and I decided to put that into writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like to talk about things women talk about behind closed doors, and I just sing about it unbothered. The song (\"Maradona\") is just about a woman who\\'s tired of a player. In the song, the guy is describing how his cheating episode went down. Can you imagine he had the gumption to describe it to the woman?! Women go through this and I just wanted to put it in writing. It was audacious!\\r\\n\\r\\nNiniola is known as the Queen of Afro House in Nigeria\\r\\n\\r\\nAO: You speak very frankly about women\\'s bodies, but you also speak very frankly about sex. You exist in an industry where there can be a double standard. Does that kind of audaciousness, like you said, come with any cost?\\r\\n\\r\\nNA: No, it doesn\\'t actually because people say that I ooze confidence through my music even without meeting me or seeing my face or anything like that. There\\'s nothing dirty about talking about your life experiences and I\\'m tired of women waiting for men to talk about or explain this experience with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet it come from my lips as a woman. I can tickle the fantasy and I can be frank with you. I can be confident and let you know, \\'this is wrong, stop it.\\' This is how I want it because a lot of women are not confident enough to voice their opinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimeon Apata, Niniola\\'s father\\r\\n\\r\\nAO: Your father was such an important part of your life. When you think of your success now and you think of him and how much he influenced your journey coming up, what kind of thoughts do you have?\\r\\n\\r\\nNA: My father (Simeon Apata) was everything to me and to everyone, and he always wanted to be better. He gave his life to his family and the nation. He was an ex-soldier. He left the army due to a leg injury. In our area, he was sort of like an unsolicited vigilante. When robbers would come into the neighborhood, instead of calling the police first, the neighborhood would call my father first. He was that kind of hero.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember that day assassins came in -- he had a bad leg and they kicked one of his legs and he fell to the ground. And he was asking them, \\'What you want? What? Tell me what you need?\\' and they told him, point blank, \\'We came for your soul and that\\'s what we\\'re taking away.\\' Right in front of his family. He begged them not to hurt anybody and just take his life if they had to.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was shot in our presence. It is still traumatizing. I can never, ever get over it. We can never forget about him, forget him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNiniola\\'s three mothers\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father married three wives and he made sure that we lived in harmony before he died and that\\'s what we continued, even after his death. It taught me how to share with people, because you just had to share. You had to look after people, you had to do your house chores. It basically taught me how to love and how to be responsible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took me a while to understand that it\\'s not like the normal family because to me, I grew up there and it was normal to me. The life lessons I learned in my house -- they carried me through.\\r\\n\\r\\nAO: Were your father\\'s killers ever found?\\r\\n\\r\\nNA: No, my mom was telling me that some people were apprehended. I don\\'t know what they said happened. But today, I still miss him -- I still feel that void and he\\'s always going to be a part of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeniola \"Teni\" Apata, Niniola\\'s sister\\r\\n\\r\\nAO: Your sister, Teni (Teniola Apata) is also in the music industry and you both are very successful. How have you supported each other through this journey?\\r\\n\\r\\nNA: It feels good to know that I have a sibling in the industry and she\\'s also a superstar. It shows that my late father has good genes because yes, my family is blessed [laughs]. I gave her a few tips and advice. You just need to work for your own, and you have the talent and sky is just the beginning. But it just shows that my surname, Apata, which means rock, we stand on a steady rock and my name Niniola means to have wealth, so we\\'re blessed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAO: How does that happen though? That you have two siblings growing up who are so musically inclined? You talked about listening to lots of music as a child. Was yours a musical family? Were you both encouraged to explore your talents?\\r\\n\\r\\nNA: No, not really. Like I said, I was in a big family. It was fun and this is what I did: I\\'d round up my little cousins and siblings and I\\'d force them to back me up [laughs]. Of all the kids there, it was only Teni that was super interested, and that\\'s where she picked up the flair for music.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUST WATCHED Watch the full episode of African Voices featuring Niniola Replay More Videos ...

That's been the narrative for several years, right? Bigs were going extinct. Playoff teams built around hulking 5s, no matter how dominant, couldn't seriously contend for a title. The rising tide of three-point shooting, the necessity of defensive switchability, the doubling down on skill over sizeâ\\x80\\x94all of it suggested there was some kind of cap on how effective a true big man could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis season, Jokic and Embiid are forcing a reconsideration of all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe those old-school types really are being shoved out of the game. But these two are legitimate MVP candidates, probably ranking somewhere in the top three on most informal ballots.

Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn\\'t a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it\\'s just a year or two away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirline officials won\\'t even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,\" he says. \"These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping cabins calm\\r\\n\\r\\nFlight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don\\'t recline.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don\\'t want to take on any more policing of passengers\\' social behaviors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are strongly against voice calls on planes,\" she wrote in a recent email.

In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,\" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'re a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you\\'re not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you\\'re focusing on your phone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPassengers advocating for quiet\\r\\n\\r\\nMost passengers don\\'t want to listen to their fellow travelers talk on their cell phones. Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an \"annoying\" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to be forced to overhear someone else\\'s conversation if it\\'s avoidable,\" he says. \"It\\'s bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby.

For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the technology safe?\\r\\n\\r\\nNewer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers\\' technology. Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you\\'re 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rise of smartphones changed everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone\\'s radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. \"But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn\\'t have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,\" says Miller. \"There\\'s no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInternationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.\\r\\n\\r\\nViasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company\\'s vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company\\'s systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,\" he says. \"When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRegulatory, practical obstacles\\r\\n\\r\\nTexting is already permitted on some airlines. Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it\\'s not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, \"The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there\\'s email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho calls people anyway?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,\" he says. \"On the flip side, now that we know there\\'s no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it\\'s not a given that airlines will embrace it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means you may not be able to join that upcoming work call from 35,000 feet over the Mississippi Delta.',\n",

In the 1920s, it wasn\\'t unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro\\'s new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Copenhagen\\'s Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content These are predicted to be the safest countries in the world to visit in 2020\\r\\n\\r\\nGreater accessibility\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circular line has 17 new stops, nearly doubling the number of existing stations.

Residents won\\'t need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen\\'s hygge-inducing winters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. \"First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,\" he said. \"But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCourtesy The Copenhagen Metro\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,\" said Olsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding the line was not without its challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people\\'s daily lives. \"We had the machinery right outside people\\'s windows for quite a substantial number of years,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass and light are key design elements, and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik\\'s Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station.\\r\\n\\r\\nControlling groundwater was also imperative during construction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,\" explained Olsen, \"If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they\\'ll rot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system.\\r\\n\\r\\nShiny, new rails\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company\\r\\n\\r\\nThe line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing.

But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeedless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After communism, the room was destroyed,\" says VarrÃ³. \"The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away.

Orange, red and pink LED lights dance across the towers like burning flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some in Baku, they\\'re now a symbol of home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can see Flame Towers as you fly into the airport, lit up with multicolored lights and shining the way,\" fashion designer and media professional Nina Zandnia tells CNN Travel. \"They\\'re the sign that lets everybody know they\\'ve reached Azerbaijan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what\\'s it like to stay in one of the country\\'s most familiar landmarks? It\\'s certainly no ordinary hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bold, sometimes bombastic statements begin with the dramatic exterior and keep going all the way inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe venue\\'s seven-story lobby is dominated by an extravagant chandelier, using five kilometers of strands, decorated with 840 lights and more than 600,000 crystal beads, and weighing a whopping two metric tons.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking pride of place below is a limited edition black and red Fazioli, one of the most expensive pianos in the world. The M Liminal , designed by NYT Line and Philippe Gendre, was purportedly accompanied Nigar Jamal and Eldar Gasimov in the performance that took Azerbaijan to victory in the 2011 edition of the annual Eurovision song contest.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests shouldn\\'t expect to hear it used in any casual jam sessions, it\\'s now only played by top pianists on special occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCome evening, the Flame Towers put on a light show enjoyed across the city. Courtesy Fairmont Baku\\r\\n\\r\\nSea views\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower is home to more than 300 rooms, suites and serviced apartments, that range in price from $170 to upwards of $5,000 a night.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the most basic offer ceiling-to-floor windows and sumptuously large double beds. The dÃ©cor is a contemporary luxury mix, with plush carpets and modern furniture. Spacious and comfortable, each room in the hotel either looks out over the city or across the bay into the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrisp and glamorous as it is, it does have an edge of corporate blandness that falls short of the regal vibes felt, for example, in the nearby Four Seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical one-bedroom suite on the 17th floor offers views of the Caspian Sea and, if eligible, access to the Fairmont Gold lounge on the 19th floor, which comes with a private check-in area and concierge service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe super-fast elevator to the 17th opens onto a spectacular landing with views across the bay. Once inside the suite, there\\'s a lobby area, are more jaw-dropping views, an office-slash-dining room, with wooden desk and a four-seater dining table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there\\'s a generous, richly carpeted lounge with an oversized sofa and jazzy signature chair. The separate bedroom has a huge king-sized bed. There\\'s an enormous walk-in closet stacked with hangers, drawers and laundry essentials that leads into a large bathroom complete with bath and shower room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both of the suite\\'s two bathrooms, there are bespoke toiletries -- yes, your name is printed on the shampoo, moisturizer and conditioner bottle.

Yes, says, Zumrud Ismayilova, the hotel\\'s PR and marketing manager. Names are not named, but the list apparently includes leaders, royals and celebrities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have had many VIP guests stay at the hotel, but we would never disclose who they are,\" she tells CNN Travel. \"When our guests come to stay with us, they expect privacy and confidentiality and that is exactly what we give them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPositioned at the very tip of the flame, the Royal Suite offers panoramic views of both city and sea. There are two bedrooms, both with en suite bathrooms, a lounge, private dining room, study, a guest bathroom, a kitchen and a grand hallway with chandelier -- 375 square meters (4,036 square feet) of living space in total.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The VIP or family will stay in the suite, but the rest of their party tends to take over the entire floor. We have additional rooms for security and staff, and a suite for extra family members,\" explains Ismayilova.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s an open-plan living area, private study, a dining room fit for for 12 or more guests and a fully equipped kitchen (for the servants, of course). But the main attraction is the grand en suite bathroom with a vast oyster-shaped bath complete with window view over the bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nWellness\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hotels amenities are a mixed bag. There\\'s an elegant spa spread over two floors of the hotel with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, hammam and spaces to unwind. There\\'s also a fully equipped gym.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beautifully designed Sky Garden allows guests the luxury of relaxing on the sundeck or taking advantage of the poolside sauna while looking out at the sea. There\\'s an S-shaped rooftop pool and outdoor bar, which look better from a distance than close up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s best visited come evening. When the sun\\'s up, the towers reflect the sun and magnify its heat, making this area a frying pan.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Bathing in Baku: How to hammam like a local\\r\\n\\r\\nFood and entertainment\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you\\'d hope from a fancy hotel inside one of the country\\'s biggest landmarks, the main Le Bistro restaurant offers an array of local Azerbaijani wines and delicacies. The Balcon cafÃ© offers specialty teas and cakes, as well as sushi in the afternoons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s also the Nur lounge which is a funky setting serving cocktails and snacks, and is a good pre-drinks site to soak in the atmosphere before moving onto the hotel\\'s Jazz Club, a local institution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We always recommend people to check out the Jazz Club after 9 p.m., because that\\'s when it really gets going. It\\'s very popular with both the hotel guests and the locals, and we always offer something new to keep people entertained,\" Ismayilova says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two things that most hotels are unable to provide -- a shopping mall and cinema. Fairmont Flame Towers offers both.\\r\\n\\r\\nPark Cinema provides guests (and members of the public) with six screens, including IMAX, showing the latest Arabic, English and Russian language films.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext door is the Flame Towers Shopping Mall, due for completion in early 2020.

       " '(CNN) â\\x80\\x94 There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s one long-lived corner of the globe you won\\'t have heard talked about as much, and it\\'s home to the world\\'s only Museum of Longevity. That\\'s Lerik in southern Azerbaijan\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Museum of Longevity\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region\\'s oldest inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt charts individual lifespans with the household items that they\\'ve outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum\\'s walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define \"centenarian\" more loosely than you\\'d expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tale of the 168-year-old man\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this the world\\'s oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla Rzayeva\\r\\n\\r\\nLerik\\'s current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That\\'s a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area\\'s most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nCountless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it\\'s perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, \"Dear Grandpa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Stillness of the mind\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran , but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father\\'s modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father).\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as \"vulnerable\" by UNESCO.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shows off her passport, which doesn\\'t list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, \"15.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,\" the museum guide says. \"They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGood nutrition and natural remedies\\r\\n\\r\\nHalima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla Rzayeva\\r\\n\\r\\nQambarova\\'s day starts at dawn; she doesn\\'t let herself sleep in. \"I get up as soon as my eyes open,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it\\'s believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nQambarova\\'s daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don\\'t have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,\" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she\\'s never taken any medication.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Azerbaijan: Culinary gateway to the East\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerations living side by side\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Abbasov\\'s side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Whatever God gives\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nLerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,\" his son says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of food, he eats \"whatever God gives\" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor.\\r\\n\\r\\n2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain , found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik\\'s longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough.',\n",

It\\'s purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, most visitors who arrive at the no-frills Yanar Dag visitors\\' center come for the spectacle rather than religious fulfillment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe experience is most impressive at night, or in winter. When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it\\'s a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it.

The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for \"home of fire\" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent.\\r\\n\\r\\nA natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku\\'s main gas supply and is only lit for visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it\\'s as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerchants and ascetics\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilt like a caravanserai-style travelers\\' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold.',\n",

Se trata de una figura que antes se desempeÃ±Ã³ como asesor principal y microgestor con responsabilidades de gran alcance. Kushner incluso tenÃ\\xada una carta blanca virtual. Pero ahora se alejado, segÃºn dicen varias personas que trabajaron de cerca con Ã©l en la Casa Blanca o que estÃ¡n familiarizadas con su pensamiento y que hablaron con CNN bajo reserva para mantener las relaciones.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«En este momento, Ã©l acaba de salir de la polÃ\\xadticaÂ», sostuvo una persona. Lo que hace eco de la mentalidad de la esposa de Kushner, Ivanka Trump, quien estÃ¡ tan cansada de la burbuja polÃ\\xadtica que recientemente ha dicho a sus amigos y colegas que no digan nada relacionado con Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nTras la derrota electoral de Trump y su posiciÃ³n actual fuera del poder, la ausencia de Kushner sigue un patrÃ³n. El cual los crÃ\\xadticos han seÃ±alado anteriormente: estar presente para las victorias y desaparecer para las derrotas. Una persona con estrechos vÃ\\xadnculos con Kushner le dijo a CNN que el yerno de Trump estÃ¡ disfrutando Â«de un tiempo muy necesario con su familiaÂ». Y aÃ±adiÃ³ que su retiro no estÃ¡ relacionado con los altibajos de la popularidad del expresidente.\\r\\n\\r\\nDurante el gobierno de Trump, Kushner estuvo mÃ¡s que dispuesto a hablar en nombre de los momentos que resultaron buenos para la Casa Blanca. Pero, tambiÃ©n, a omitir convenientemente las partes de los lÃ\\xados polÃ\\xadticos.\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nServicio Secreto de Ivanka Trump paga para ir al baÃ±o 0:37\\r\\n\\r\\nYa en 2017, cuando el plan de salud de Trump tuvo problemas y fracasÃ³, Kushner y su familia estaban en las laderas de Aspen, Colorado. En 2018, se encontraban de vacaciones en Florida en medio del cierre del gobierno. A pesar incluso de que la Casa Blanca insistiÃ³ en que Kushner lideraba activamente las negociaciones. Y en 2019, cuando Trump fue criticado por mÃºltiples problemas, desde verificaciones de antecedentes hasta comentarios sobre judÃ\\xados y demÃ³cratas, la pareja pasaba un tiempo de inactividad en Wyoming. Algo que incluso destacÃ³ Trump en un tuit con una foto de ellos en su descanso. Â«Dos personas increÃ\\xadbles . Â¡No puedo creer que no estÃ©n trabajando (pocos trabajan mÃ¡s duro)!Â», escribiÃ³ en el mensaje.\\r\\n\\r\\nUna portavoz de Trump no dio una respuesta oficial a la solicitud de comentarios de CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin embargo, no estÃ¡ claro quiÃ©n estÃ¡ instigando esta ruptura, al menos por ahora. Algunos que han estado en contacto con Kushner dicen que se cansÃ³ de las payasadas de su suegro. Fuentes mÃ¡s cercanas a Trump seÃ±alan que Ã©l estÃ¡ enojado con su yerno por la derrota electoral.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos mismos de Trump, menos uno: Jared Kushner\\r\\n\\r\\nEl hecho de que a Kushner le disguste el apetito polÃ\\xadtico de su suegro es cuestionable por el momento en que ocurre. Un indicio de que Kushner nuevamente estÃ¡ poniendo distancia entre su imagen y la de Trump. Lo que tambiÃ©n sucede despuÃ©s del flujo delirante de falsedades que siguiÃ³ al dÃ\\xada de las elecciones. Y a la insurrecciÃ³n mortal incitada por Trump en el Capitolio el 6 de enero.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin embargo, varias personas dijeron a CNN que Kushner realmente, en esta ocasiÃ³n, estÃ¡ efectivamente cansado de la retÃ³rica de Trump.\\r\\n\\r\\nKushner e Ivanka Trump salieron de su elegante casa de alquiler en Washington poco despuÃ©s del 20 de enero. Y los Ãºltimos camiones de mudanza que se dirigÃ\\xadan a su nuevo rascacielos junto a la playa en Miami partieron 24 horas despuÃ©s de la toma de posesiÃ³n del presidente Joe Biden. Otra persona familiarizada con el nuevo capÃ\\xadtulo de Kushner dice que Ã©l quiere un cierre y un nuevo comienzo. Uno que no incluya asesorar a su suegro todos los dÃ\\xadas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin embargo, otras dos personas que hablaron con CNN indicaron que el cisma lo instigÃ³ Trump. Incluso, el expresidente ha dicho a sus cÃ\\xadrculos Ã\\xadntimos que estÃ¡ enojado con Kushner.\\r\\n\\r\\nA finales de la semana pasada, Trump convocÃ³ lo que cree es su grupo de expertos mÃ¡s fuertes para una reuniÃ³n. El objetivo era discutir su futuro polÃ\\xadtico, pero no incluyÃ³ a Kushner. El grupo analizÃ³ las elecciones de medio tÃ©rmino de 2022 y, mÃ¡s probablemente, una carrera presidencial en 2024, dicen personas que han hablado con el expresidente Ãºltimamente.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos asistentes se acomodaron en las dependencias privadas de Trump en Mar-a-Lago, su club/sede posterior a la Casa Blanca/hogar en Palm Beach. Entre los asesores estuvieron el exdirector de campaÃ±a Bill Stepien, el asesor Jason Miller y el exdirector de redes de la Casa Blanca Dan Scavino. TambiÃ©n el hijo de Trump, Donald Trump Jr., y otro exgerente de campaÃ±a, Brad Parscale. Justamente, a este Ãºltimo Kushner lo despidiÃ³ a pedido de Trump el verano pasado y lo reemplazÃ³ con Stepien.\\r\\n\\r\\nSobre la mesa estuvo crear un gran comitÃ© de acciÃ³n polÃ\\xadtica (PAC, por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) para recaudar dinero. TambiÃ©n una discusiÃ³n mÃ¡s amplia sobre quiÃ©n harÃ\\xada quÃ© mientras Trump determina dÃ³nde, cuÃ¡ndo y a quiÃ©n repartir su enorme influencia dentro de un partido republicano fracturado.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump reaparece y promete represalias 0:41\\r\\n\\r\\nQue Kushner no estÃ© presente en una mesa redonda estratÃ©gica sorprendiÃ³ a muchos que saben de su profunda participaciÃ³n en todos los aspectos del mensaje polÃ\\xadtico de Trump, y es extraÃ±o.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Eso es lo mÃ¡s parecido a un giro de 180 grados que podrÃ\\xada hacerÂ», sostuvo una tercera persona, que trabajaba dentro de la Casa Blanca de Trump con Kushner. Â«Este era un tipo que durante cuatro aÃ±os hizo todo en nombre del presidente Trump. VivÃ\\xada por ese trabajoÂ», aÃ±adiÃ³.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtro excolega de la Casa Blanca expresÃ³ su sorpresa por la decisiÃ³n de Kushner de retirarse. En ese sentido, seÃ±alÃ³ que no habÃ\\xada nada en los asuntos la administraciÃ³n en lo que Kushner no Â«se entrometieraÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nDesde la polÃ\\xadtica nacional, la polÃ\\xadtica exterior, la dotaciÃ³n de personal, la redacciÃ³n de discursos, la seguridad nacional, la reforma de la justicia penal, el presupuesto, el covid-19: Kushner participaba en todo.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Era un â\\x80\\x98expertoâ\\x80\\x99 en todoÂ», dijo el excolega. Y destacÃ³ que el hecho de que Kushner pasara de un tema a otro era a menudo la pesadilla de algunos altos funcionarios del Ala Oeste.\\r\\n\\r\\nUna relaciÃ³n que se distanciÃ³\\r\\n\\r\\nPero la capacidad de Kushner, como de Ivanka Trump, para maniobrar dentro y fuera de los asuntos, dÃ\\xada tras dÃ\\xada, se debiÃ³ en parte a que pertenecÃ\\xadan a la familia.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«No es como si Trump pudiera despedir a su yerno, o darle un apodo y atacarlo en TwitterÂ», dijo la persona que trabajÃ³ dentro de la Casa Blanca de Trump.\\r\\n\\r\\nComo tal, Kushner pudo ser un estratega en jefe y una voz influyente para el entonces presidente.\\r\\n\\r\\nPero no lo es tanto ahora.\\r\\n\\r\\nDos de las personas que hablaron con CNN dicen que la relaciÃ³n de Kushner con Trump, sea su yerno o no, se fracturÃ³ desde la derrota de la reelecciÃ³n.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump, dicen, ha expresado a sus allegados en algunas ocasiones durante las Ãºltimas semanas que culpa a Kushner por perder.\\r\\n\\r\\nUna persona que habla con Kushner frecuentemente niega enÃ©rgicamente cualquier disputa entre los dos hombres. AdemÃ¡s, seÃ±alÃ³ que Kushner y Trump se reunieron para almorzar este miÃ©rcoles en Florida en la propiedad de Trump en Doral.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin embargo, Kushner serÃ\\xada un sustituto plausible. Justamente, fue Ã©l quien orquestÃ³ gran parte de la respuesta de la administraciÃ³n a, esencialmente, la mayorÃ\\xada de las cosas. Desde la economÃ\\xada hasta la reforma inmigratoria. Incluso, en Ãºltima instancia, el coronavirus. AdemÃ¡s, Â¿quiÃ©n puede olvidar la promesa de Kushner en abril pasado durante una entrevista acerca de que Estados Unidos estarÃ\\xada Â«realmente â\\x80\\x98rockeandoâ\\x80\\x99 de nuevoÂ» en julio?\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Sabemos que el jefe no se va a culpar a sÃ\\xad mismoÂ» (por perder las elecciones), dijo una fuente sobre la naturaleza de su relaciÃ³n. En ese sentido destacÃ³ la costumbre de Trump de evitar la responsabilidad personal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin embargo, si es Trump quien mantiene a Kushner a distancia, o viceversa, hay algo claro para quienes han hablado con Kushner en las Ãºltimas semanas: Â«Quiere un descansoÂ», dijo una persona familiarizada con su pensamiento. Pero la fuente anticipÃ³ que despuÃ©s de un perÃ\\xadodo de reflexiÃ³n, y si Trump decide lanzar una campaÃ±a en 2024, es probable que Kushner vuelva al redil como asesor.\\r\\n\\r\\nPero, por ahora, Kushner estÃ¡ mÃ¡s que dispuesto a ver a Trump Jr. o incluso a Parscale asumir el papel de susurrador y figura leal a Trump. Aunque el colaborador cercano a Kushner dijo que vigila a Stepien, Parscale y Miller, y habla con ellos con frecuencia.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarias de las personas que hablaron con CNN seÃ±alaron que los intereses perifÃ©ricos de Kushner aÃºn incluyen un enfoque continuo en el Medio Oriente. EspecÃ\\xadficamente, en la negociaciÃ³n de acuerdos de paz y en la ayuda a garantizar que se afiancen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTambiÃ©n le gustarÃ\\xada ser parte del avance de la reforma de la justicia penal, como revivir la libertad condicional en el sistema penitenciario federal. Algo que fue eliminado en 1984 y Kushner cree que merece un nuevo examen.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«EstÃ¡ tratando de ser alguien a quien acudir del lado republicano para lograr un acuerdoÂ», dijo la persona familiarizada con la posible trayectoria profesional de Kushner.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin embargo, en el futuro cercano, no esperes ver a Kushner entre los exasesores presidenciales que se ofrecen voluntariamente para una segunda ronda.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«El drama de la polÃ\\xadtica lo agotÃ³. Eventualmente, Trump desgasta a todosÂ», dijo la persona.',\n",

Y hay buena evidencia de que ayudan a prevenir la propagaciÃ³n de covid-19. Sin embargo, no son un Â«escudoÂ» total, dijo Schaffner. La gente todavÃ\\xada necesita tomar decisiones informadas sobre el riesgo.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos CDC deben lograr un equilibrio complicado con estas pautas, indicaron los expertos.\\r\\n\\r\\nLas guÃ\\xadas deben alentar a las personas a vacunarse y ayudar a los vacunados a comprender que aÃºn deben tener cuidado. AdemÃ¡s de gestionar las expectativas de los no vacunados.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«No queremos que la gente que no estÃ¡ completamente vacunada piense que todo se ha levantado, que podemos dejar las cosas atrÃ¡s, y que la pandemia se acabÃ³, porque no es asÃ\\xadÂ», advirtiÃ³ el funcionario.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¿PodrÃ¡ Johnson & Johnson fabricar 1.000 millones de vacunas? 3:14\\r\\n\\r\\nSe registraron mÃ¡s de 64.000 casos de covid-19 reciÃ©n diagnosticados en EE.UU. solo este jueves.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo es como volver a 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nLas pautas no darÃ¡n permiso a los vacunados para comenzar a vivir como si regresÃ¡ramos a 2019 nuevamente, segÃºn un funcionario de la administraciÃ³n de Biden.

TambiÃ©n que se mantengan a una buena distancia fÃ\\xadsica de los demÃ¡s.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Mientras nos vacunamos todos, nuestro principal objetivo social sigue siendo proteger a quienes no han recibido la vacunaÂ», dijo Richterman.\\r\\n\\r\\nLas mÃ¡scaras ayudan a hacer precisamente eso. Y no hay garantÃ\\xada de que las personas vacunadas no porten el virus en la nariz o la garganta. Un virus que puede no enfermar al portador, pero que podrÃ\\xada ser expulsado e infectar a alguien que aÃºn no estÃ© vacunado.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Las mÃ¡scaras continÃºan funcionando y las necesitamos contra las variantesÂ», sostuvo Schaffner. A los expertos en salud pÃºblica les preocupa que la propagaciÃ³n de las variantes mÃ¡s contagiosas pueda prolongar la pandemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nLas pautas tambiÃ©n deberÃ\\xadan ayudar a los vacunados a manejar las interacciones con sus seres queridos en sus hogares de ancianos. Justamente, quienes han estado aislados durante mÃ¡s de un aÃ±o. AdemÃ¡s deben incluir consejos de viaje.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesafortunadamente, la vacunaciÃ³n no es un Â«pase gratuito para viajarÂ«, advirtiÃ³ el Dr. Anthony Fauci en un foro global de CNN a principios de febrero. El director del Instituto Nacional de Alergias y Enfermedades Infecciosas dijo que viajar Â«esencialÂ» es un sÃ\\xad. Â«Pero, no queremos que la gente piense que porque se vacunÃ³, entonces otras recomendaciones de salud pÃºblica simplemente no aplicanÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nLas pautas no serÃ¡n totalmente prescriptivas ni te dirÃ¡n exactamente lo que puedes y no puedes hacer una vez que estÃ©s completamente vacunado.\\r\\n\\r\\nLas guÃ\\xadas no te dirÃ¡n si puedes o no jugar a los bolos con la tÃ\\xada Mary, por ejemplo. Ni si puedes o no puede encontrarte con el abuelo en la cafeterÃ\\xada para un juego de Settlers of Catan con la nueva estrategia que aprendiste mientras estaba atrapado en casa.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Es imposible llegar a ese nivel de detalle. No podemos predecir todas las situaciones en las que estarÃ¡n los seres humanosÂ», explicÃ³ el funcionario de Biden.

Sin embargo, el estado debe aprobar la utilizaciÃ³n del dinero de la subvenciÃ³n antes de que pueda distribuirse a las comunidades fronterizas. CNN habÃ\\xada informado anteriormente que se estaban llevando a cabo planes para usar fondos de FEMA para ayudar a las localidades a adquirir pruebas.\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«La seguridad fronteriza es una responsabilidad estrictamente federal. El Gobierno federal es el Ãºnico que tiene la responsabilidad de hacer pruebas, examinar y poner en cuarentena a los inmigrantes ilegales que cruzan nuestra frontera y que pueden tener covidÂ», dijo Abbott en un comunicado. Â«En lugar de hacer su trabajo, la administraciÃ³n Biden de sugiriÃ³ que no tenÃ\\xada recursos suficientes y, notablemente, pidiÃ³ a Texas que los ayuda a brindar asistencia en su programa de inmigraciÃ³n ilegal. Texas se negÃ³Â».\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas levanta restricciones por covid-19\\r\\n\\r\\nAbbott anunciÃ³ el martes que levantarÃ\\xada el mandato de uso obligatorio de mascarillas en Texas, incluso cuando los funcionarios de salud adverten que no se deben relar las restricciones.

Y eso puede llevarse a cabo y que se tomen medidas para el aislamiento, la cuarentena y la atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica en caso de que sea necesarioÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nEn una declaraciÃ³n enviada a CNN el viernes, un portavoz del DHS dijo que el departamento ha estado trabajando con alcaldes locales y funcionarios de salud pÃºblica de Texas para proporcionar pruebas de covid-19 y su acuerdo con los socios solicitÃ³ fondos federales para cubrir los gastos relacionados con las pruebas, el aislamiento y la cuarentena.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Esperamos que el gobernador Abbott reconsidere su decisiÃ³n de rechazar el acuerdo del DHS con las autoridades locales de Texas que permitirÃ\\xada a las familias migrantes que el gobernador Abbott dice que quiere que se haganÂ», dijo el portavoz.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa situaciÃ³n en la frontera\\r\\n\\r\\nLa administraciÃ³n de Biden todavÃ\\xada se basa en gran medida en una polÃ\\xadtica de la era Trump en la frontera entre Estados Unidos y MÃ©xico para rechazar a la gran mayorÃ\\xada de los migrantes que encuentra la Patrulla Fronteriza. Sin embargo, MÃ©xico dejÃ³ de aceptar que algunas familias fueran devueltas a ese paÃ\\xads. Ese cambio, junto al distanciamiento social en los centros de detenciÃ³n estadounidenses, ha hecho que falte espacio para los migrantes. Esto, a su vez, ha obligado a los funcionarios de la Oficina de Aduanas y ProtecciÃ³n Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) a liberar familias en Estados Unidos.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa agencia dijo en un comunicado que el personal verifica si hay sÃ\\xadntomas de covid-19 y Â«consulta con el personal mÃ©dico en el lugar, los Centros para el Control y la PrevenciÃ³n de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) o los sistemas de salud locales, segÃºn correspondaÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nEn McAllen, Texas, los funcionarios de la ciudad solicitaron a los funcionarios estatales miles de tests para el covid-19 en enero despuÃ©s de enterarse de que la CBP no estaba haciendo pruebas a los migrantes. Catholic Charities administrÃ³ las pruebas. Si los inmigrantes dan positivo, la organizaciÃ³n los ayuda para que hagan cuarentena en un hotel local.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolicitudes de pruebas\\r\\n\\r\\nLa DivisiÃ³n de Manejo de Emergencias de Texas le dijo a CNN el jueves que recibiÃ³ y atendiÃ³ solicitudes de pruebas de covid-19 por parte de funcionarios locales de comunidades fronterizas. Â«Desde fines de enero, el estado ha proporcionado 40.000 pruebas de covid-19 a Brownsville, McAllen, Laredo y Del Rio para hacer frente a la necesidad de pruebas que el Gobierno federal no estÃ¡ atendiendoÂ», dijo Seth W. Christensen, jefe de medios y comunicaciones de la agencia, en un comunicado.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl alcalde de Brownsville, Juan Â«TreyÂ» Mendez III, dijo el jueves que 108 migrantes de un total de cerca de 1.700 dieron positivo por covid-19 en la ciudad. ConsiderÃ³ que esta cifra no es alarmante, a pesar de las crÃ\\xadticas de los funcionarios estatales. MÃ©ndez dijo que Brownsville recibiÃ³ alrededor de 10.000 pruebas de la DivisiÃ³n de Manejo de Emergencias de Texas. De ese total, la ciudad ha administrado alrededor de 2.000.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Tenemos una tasa de positividad de poco mÃ¡s del 6%Â», dijo Mendez, y agregÃ³ que ese nÃºmero estÃ¡ a la par con lo que se estÃ¡ viendo en todo el estado.\\r\\n\\r\\nEn enero, la seguridad fronteriza encontrÃ³ a cerca de 7.500 familias en la frontera entre Estados Unidos y MÃ©xico, segÃºn los datos mensuales mÃ¡s recientes de la agencia.

(CrÃ©dito: Sandro Castro/Instagram)\\r\\n\\r\\n(CNN EspaÃ±ol) â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x93 Sandro Castro Arteaga, nieto del fallecido lÃ\\xadder cubano Fidel Castro, asegurÃ³ este jueves que no es suyo el Mercedes Benz que aparece manejando en un video que circulÃ³ en redes sociales esta semana y que se volviÃ³ viral, en medio de una polÃ©mica acerca de si eso era una exhibiciÃ³n de lujo.\\r\\n\\r\\nEn un video que publicÃ³ en su cuenta de Instagram, Castro Arteaga pidiÃ³ disculpas pÃºblicas a familiares y amistades Â«que pudieran haberse sentido ofendidosÂ» y explicÃ³ que el auto en el que se grabÃ³ el video es de un Â«conocidoÂ» suyo que se lo Â«prestÃ³Â». Â«Y a mÃ\\xad me gustan los autos para yo probarlo. Y ahÃ\\xad fue donde se grabÃ³ realmente este videoÂ». Inmediatamente despuÃ©s se refiere a la frase que generÃ³ crÃ\\xadticas en redes sociales. Â«Cuando yo me referÃ\\xada a los juguetes que tenÃ\\xada en casa, lo dije en broma porque definitivamente el carro no es mÃ\\xado. Y pido unas disculpas muy sinceras para todo el que malinterpretÃ³ esto o lo pudo ofender. Me disculpo ante todosÂ», insistiÃ³.\\r\\n\\r\\nCastro Arteaga reconociÃ³ que las imÃ¡genes sÃ\\xad son de Ã©l. Aunque, dijo, inicialmente solo las publicÃ³ en sus Â«estados de WhatsApp para mis contactos cercanos, de confianza, y allegados a mÃ\\xadÂ». TambiÃ©n agregÃ³ que Â«por razones en contra de mi voluntad, ese video trascendiÃ³ a otros mediosÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nEn el video que previamente generÃ³ polÃ©mica y cuestionamientos en redes, se observa a Castro Arteaga en compaÃ±Ã\\xada de una mujer, mientras acelera el Mercedes Benz hasta los 140 km/h. Durante la grabaciÃ³n, el joven dice: Â«Nosotros somos sencillos, pero de vez en cuando hay que sacar estos jugueticos que tenemos en casaÂ». Entonces le pide a su acompaÃ±ante que enfoque el velocÃ\\xadmetro. Luego agrega: Â«Mira quÃ© rico, eso cÃ³mo va a 140, caballero. Son cosas gordas mi gente, para que no se equivoquenÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN no puede confirmar de manera independiente que el auto es propiedad de Castro o no.\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nEl joven termina el video en el que pidiÃ³ disculpas aclarando que hay una cuenta falsa de Twitter a su nombre y que la Ãºnica red social en la que tiene un perfil es en Instagram. Â«Yo no tengo ni Twitter, no tengo ni Facebook. Solamente tengo el Instagram y a mÃ\\xad no me interesan ni las redes sociales ni la popularidad. Soy una persona sencilla y asÃ\\xad es como me considero. Y las personas cercanas a mÃ\\xad y allegadas a mÃ\\xad, saben que lo que estoy diciendo es realmente verdadÂ», concluyÃ³.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN intentÃ³ comunicarse con Sandro Castro para obtener comentarios al respecto, pero aÃºn no ha recibido respuesta. Hasta el momento no hay declaraciÃ³n oficial del Gobierno de Cuba sobre el primer video o la declaraciÃ³n de Castro y no se le ha dado respuesta a CNN a su solicitud de comentario.\\r\\n\\r\\nSandro Castro es hijo de Alexis Castro Soto del Valle, uno de los cinco hijos de Fidel Castro y Dalia Soto del Valle, la segunda esposa del lÃ\\xadder cubano, con quien estuvo hasta su muerte en 2016. SegÃºn el medio Radio TelevisiÃ³n MartÃ\\xad, que es parte de la Agencia de EE.UU. para los Medios Globales, Castro Arteaga es dueÃ±o de dos bares en La Habana, Fantaxy y EFE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdemÃ¡s, no es el primero de la familia de Fidel Castro que vive una polÃ©mica por contenidos difundidos en redes sociales. Tony Castro, tambiÃ©n nieto del lÃ\\xadder cubano e hijo de Antonio Castro, fue noticia en medios de comunicaciÃ³n en 2019 por las fotos de viajes y lujos que publicaba en su cuenta de Instagram. Actualmente, el perfil del joven en esta red social es privado, pero muchas fueron publicadas por otros usuarios y medios.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa controversia surge en la medida en que los habitantes de Cuba sufren por la precaria situaciÃ³n econÃ³mica de la isla. El paÃ\\xads tiene un PIB per cÃ¡pita de US$ 12.100 (cifras estimadas de 2016 por la CIA), lo que lo ubica en el puesto 131 a nivel mundial. En comparaciÃ³n, el PIB per cÃ¡pita en EE.UU. es de US$ 62.530. El Gobierno de Cuba, paÃ\\xads que sufre escasez de alimentos en medio de la pandemia, dio un paso hacia la expansiÃ³n masiva del sector privado de la isla permitiendo que los cubanos pronto puedan buscar empleo o iniciar negocios en la mayorÃ\\xada de los campos de trabajo.\\r\\n\\r\\nCon informaciÃ³n de SebastiÃ¡n JimÃ©nez, de CNN en EspaÃ±ol.',\n",

Se pronosticÃ³ que se mantendrÃ\\xada plana.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos economistas estÃ¡n de acuerdo en que la tasa oficial de desempleo probablemente no informa cuÃ¡ntas personas estÃ¡n realmente desempleadas como resultado de la pandemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nPor ejemplo, a 4,2 millones de personas que abandonaron la fuerza laboral se les impidiÃ³ buscar un nuevo trabajo debido a la pandemia de febrero, dijo la Oficina de EstadÃ\\xadsticas Laborales.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«El informe de hoy muestra brotes verdes de recuperaciÃ³nÂ», indicÃ³ Daniel Zhao, economista senior de Glassdoor.

Si bien ese nÃºmero finalmente estÃ¡ disminuyendo, millones de trabajadores tienen que depender de la ayuda del gobierno para llegar a fin de mes. A pesar de las buenas noticias en el informe del viernes, Â«todavÃ\\xada hay mucha madera que cortarÂ», comentÃ³ el economista senior de BMO, Sal Guatieri.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl jueves, el Departamento de Trabajo informÃ³ que mÃ¡s de 18 millones de personas recibieron beneficios en virtud de varios programas del gobierno en la semana que terminÃ³ el 13 de febrero.\\r\\n\\r\\nY la tasa de participaciÃ³n de la fuerza laboral se mantuvo plana en 61,4% en febrero. No ha sido tan baja desde la dÃ©cada de 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa desigualdad en la recuperaciÃ³n\\r\\n\\r\\nLos economistas y polÃ\\xadticos llaman a la recuperaciÃ³n Â«en forma de KÂ» porque no estÃ¡ funcionando para todos. Si bien muchos trabajadores de cuello blanco y personas que invierten en el mercado de valores han visto aumentar su riqueza a travÃ©s de la pandemia, los trabajadores con salarios mÃ¡s bajos luchan para pagar sus necesidades bÃ¡sicas.\\r\\n\\r\\nUna mirada de cÃ³mo les fue a los diferentes grupos demogrÃ¡ficos en febrero ofrece mÃ¡s pruebas de la recuperaciÃ³n desigual, aunque los economistas advierten que los datos mensuales pueden ser volÃ¡tiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa tasa de desempleo asiÃ¡tica cayÃ³ al 5,1% el mes pasado con respecto al 6,6% anterior registrado, lo que marca la mayor mejora de cualquier grupo demogrÃ¡fico medido en el informe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLas tasas de desempleo de blancos e hispanos bajaron un 0,1 punto porcentual cada una, a 5,6% y 8,5%, respectivamente.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl empleo tanto asiÃ¡tico como hispano probablemente fue impulsado por las ganancias en el sector de la hostelerÃ\\xada y el placer, en la que ambos grupos estÃ¡n representados de manera desproporcionada, dijo Zhao.\\r\\n\\r\\nMientras tanto, la tasa de desempleo de los trabajadores negros fue al revÃ©s: saltÃ³ al 9,9% del 9,2% anterior.

Entonces, si la tasa de desempleo de los blancos es demasiado alta en 5,7% durante la pandemia, significa que la tasa de desempleo de los negros no era lo suficientemente baja en tiempos normales, agregÃ³ Zhao.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Aprobar medidas de ayuda a gran escala ahora es un imperativo de justicia econÃ³mica y racialÂ», declarÃ³ Gould.',\n",
       " \"FDA: 17 pÃ¡ginas web venden opioides ilegalmente 0:33\\r\\n\\r\\n(CNN) â\\x80\\x93 Aproximadamente uno de cada tres estudiantes de secundaria que dijeron que estaban abusando de los opioides recetados cuando fueron encuestados informaron que habÃ\\xadan intentado suicidarse, segÃºn un estudio publicado el lunes en la revista Pediatrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnteriormente, los investigadores informaron que los jÃ³venes que habÃ\\xadan abusado de los opioides recetados en cualquier momento tenÃ\\xadan un mayor riesgo de suicidio. La AsociaciÃ³n Estadounidense de PsicologÃ\\xada define que el Â«riesgo de suicidio generalmente estÃ¡ indicado por la idea o intenciÃ³n suicidaÂ» y un plan detallado para llevarla a cabo.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos autores del nuevo estudio investigaron si el momento del uso indebido de opioides recetados por los adolescentes â\\x80\\x94si era actual (en los 30 dÃ\\xadas anteriores a la encuesta), en el pasado o nuncaâ\\x80\\x94 afectÃ³ su vÃ\\xadnculo con el suicidio.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl estudio utilizÃ³ datos de mÃ¡s de 13.600 respuestas de estudiantes de secundaria de EE.UU. en la Encuesta de Comportamiento de Riesgo Juvenil de 2019 de los Centros para el Control y la PrevenciÃ³n de Enfermedades de EE.UU. (CDC, por sus siglas en inglÃ©s). Los estudiantes respondieron preguntas sobre cuÃ¡ndo y con quÃ© frecuencia habÃ\\xadan tomado analgÃ©sicos opioides especÃ\\xadficos, ya sea sin receta mÃ©dica o de manera diferente a como lo habÃ\\xadan indicado sus mÃ©dicos. Los adolescentes tambiÃ©n informaron si y cuÃ¡ntas veces habÃ\\xadan considerado seriamente intentar, planear o realmente intentar suicidarse en el Ãºltimo aÃ±o.\\r\\n\\r\\nResultados del estudio\\r\\n\\r\\nAproximadamente el 7,4% de los estudiantes informaron que habÃ\\xadan abusado de los opioides recetados al menos una vez en el pasado. Mientras que el 7,2% informÃ³ de un uso indebido una o mÃ¡s veces en el Ãºltimo mes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Hay una serie de factores que ponen a los jÃ³venes en riesgo de abusar de los opioides recetadosÂ» dijo por correo electrÃ³nico la autora principal del estudio, Natalie Wilkins, cientÃ\\xadfica del comportamiento de la DivisiÃ³n de Salud Escolar y Adolescente de los CDC. Â«Desde el punto de vista del desarrollo, los cerebros de los adolescentes aÃºn no han madurado por completo, lo que los hace mÃ¡s susceptibles a participar en conductas arriesgadas e impulsivas, como el consumo de sustanciasÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nLos investigadores encontraron que el uso indebido actual de opioides recetados, en comparaciÃ³n con el uso indebido en el pasado o nunca, se asociÃ³ de manera mÃ¡s significativa con considerar seriamente el intento de suicidio, hacer planes de suicidio y sentirse triste o desesperado en el Ãºltimo aÃ±o. Casi el 33% de los estudiantes que informaron el uso indebido de opioides recetados en la actualidad en realidad intentaron suicidarse, en comparaciÃ³n con el 19% de los adolescentes que informaron el uso indebido en el pasado y el 6% de los estudiantes que dijeron que nunca habÃ\\xadan usado indebidamente una prescripciÃ³n de opioides.\\r\\n\\r\\nPor quÃ© los estudiantes recurren a los opioides\\r\\n\\r\\nEl estudio examinÃ³ las asociaciones entre el uso indebido de opioides recetados, las tendencias suicidas y los sÃ\\xadntomas de depresiÃ³n. AÃºn no se sabe por completo si el uso indebido de opioides recetados puede provocar tendencias suicidas y sÃ\\xadntomas depresivos o viceversa. Los autores tambiÃ©n notaron que una limitaciÃ³n del estudio fue que no conocÃ\\xadan los niveles de uso indebido de los estudiantes, por ejemplo, si ocasionalmente lo usaban indebidamente o si tenÃ\\xadan un trastorno de opioides.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependientemente, la razÃ³n por la que los adolescentes comienzan a abusar de los opioides es una Â«cosa matizada y en capasÂ», dijo el Dr. Lucien GonzÃ¡lez, presidente del ComitÃ© de PrevenciÃ³n y Uso de Sustancias de la Academia Estadounidense de PediatrÃ\\xada, que no participÃ³ en el estudio.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl mal uso de los opioides\\r\\n\\r\\nEl mal uso podrÃ\\xada deberse a aliviar el dolor fÃ\\xadsico de un procedimiento mÃ©dico, la curiosidad, socializar o sucumbir a la presiÃ³n de los compaÃ±eros, aÃ±adiÃ³ GonzÃ¡lez. Algunos adolescentes pueden hacer un mal uso para aliviar la tensiÃ³n, el dolor emocional, los problemas mentales o los pensamientos suicidas. TambiÃ©n pueden querer sentir la euforia de la que han oÃ\\xaddo hablar a otras personas.\\r\\n\\r\\nA algunas personas no les gusta cÃ³mo los hacen sentir los opioides despuÃ©s de las cirugÃ\\xadas. Para otras, la intenciÃ³n inicial puede haber sido inofensiva, pero la adicciÃ³n ocurre cuando el uso casual se convierte en opioides Â«porque se sienten realmente mal cuando no lo hacenÂ», comentÃ³ Amy Green, psicÃ³loga clÃ\\xadnica y vicepresidenta de investigaciÃ³n de The Trevor Project, una organizaciÃ³n de intervenciÃ³n en crisis y prevenciÃ³n del suicidio para jÃ³venes LGBTQ. Â«Eso tambiÃ©n puede causar mucha lucha y sufrimiento y sentirse atrapado, que estÃ¡n atrapados entre el deseo de no usarlo y la lucha realÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nCon respecto a la relaciÃ³n con el suicidio, sustancias como los opioides y el alcohol pueden reducir las inhibiciones, indicÃ³ GonzÃ¡lez, quien tambiÃ©n es profesor asistente en el Departamento de PsiquiatrÃ\\xada y Ciencias del Comportamiento en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Minnesota. Eso puede hacer que algunas personas sean menos propensas a dejar de completar la ideaciÃ³n o el intento de suicidio.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisparidades entre minorÃ\\xadas\\r\\n\\r\\nHabÃ\\xada grandes disparidades entre los diferentes estudiantes: adolescentes mujeres, negros, hispanos y lesbianas, gays, bisexuales o inseguros actualmente abusan mÃ¡s de los opioides recetados que los adolescentes hombres y blancos. Algunos de los grupos minoritarios tambiÃ©n tenÃ\\xadan tasas mÃ¡s altas de sentimientos suicidas, tristes o desesperanzados en comparaciÃ³n con las tasas de los hombres y los jÃ³venes blancos. Y las diferencias entre los estudiantes heterosexuales y adolescentes lesbianas, gays, bisexuales e inseguros fueron extremas: el 23,9% de estudiantes lesbianas, gays o bisexuales y el 14,5% de los estudiantes inseguros intentaron suicidarse, en comparaciÃ³n con el 6,4% de los adolescentes heterosexuales. El 12% de adolescentes lesbianas, gays o bisexuales y el 11,5% de los adolescentes inseguros informaron el uso indebido actual de opioides recetados, en comparaciÃ³n con el 6,4% de los estudiantes heterosexuales.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos mayores riesgos que enfrentan adolescentes lesbianas, gays, bisexuales e inseguros no son causados directamente por su sexualidad, sino por la forma en que algunas personas los tratan a causa de ella, dijo Green. Â«Es mucho mÃ¡s probable que experimenten discriminaciÃ³n, victimizaciÃ³n (y) estigma debido a su identidadÂ», asegurÃ³ Green, quien tambiÃ©n es profesora asistente adjunta en la Universidad de California en San Diego. Green no participÃ³ en el estudio.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Esas experiencias conducen a estos sentimientos de vergÃ¼enza, estigma y depresiÃ³n internalizados, que tienden a resultar en cosas como pensamientos suicidas, uso indebido de medicamentos recetados, incluidos los opioides, para tratar de abordar el dolor y el sufrimiento que sientenÂ», manifestÃ³ Green.\\r\\n\\r\\nApoyo a los adolescentes LGBTQ\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Cuando los jÃ³venes LGBTQ son apoyados y reafirmados en sus identidades, cuando tienen escuelas que reconocen LGBTQ y tienen padres que los aceptan, tienen un riesgo significativamente menor de considerar e intentar suicidarseÂ», agregÃ³ Green.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos estudiantes blancos informaron mÃ¡s comÃºnmente que los estudiantes de otras razas o etnias sobre el uso indebido de opioides recetados en el pasado. Los estudiantes blancos consideraron seriamente el suicidio e hicieron un plan de suicidio. Pero menos estudiantes blancos informaron intentos de suicidio.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa mayor prevalencia de intentos de suicidio entre los estudiantes negros e hispanos puede deberse en parte al acceso inadecuado a la atenciÃ³n de salud mental general y a una atenciÃ³n que responda culturalmente a sus identidades y necesidades, observa Green.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeguridad y tratamiento del uso indebido de opioides recetados\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Debido a que los niÃ±os pueden pasar muy rÃ¡pidamente de la ideaciÃ³n a la actuaciÃ³nÂ», los padres deben crear un entorno seguro alrededor de los niÃ±os y adolescentes que pueden tener pensamientos suicidas, dijo GonzÃ¡lez.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuarde de manera segura los objetos que podrÃ\\xadan ser letales, como armas de fuego y medicamentos para el dolor o psiquiÃ¡tricos. Un estudio de 2018 encontrÃ³ que es mÃ¡s probable que los adolescentes obtengan analgÃ©sicos recetados primero a travÃ©s de las recetas de los miembros de la familia, en lugar de a travÃ©s de distribuidores o fuentes en lÃ\\xadnea. Dado que los adolescentes tambiÃ©n pueden hacer un mal uso de sus propias recetas, GonzÃ¡lez recomendÃ³ que los padres administren los medicamentos, supervisen el acceso y se deshagan de las sobras.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos signos que podrÃ\\xadan ser indicativos de abuso de sustancias u otro problema incluyen los siguientes, segÃºn GonzÃ¡lez:\\r\\n\\r\\nPupilas constreÃ±idas\\r\\n\\r\\nConfusiÃ³n\\r\\n\\r\\nHabla arrastrada\\r\\n\\r\\nRespiraciÃ³n corta y superficial\\r\\n\\r\\nEstado de Ã¡nimo o cambios de humor inusuales (cansancio, inusualmente calmado, depresiÃ³n o ansiedad que aumentan o disminuyen)\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcas en la piel o heridas punzantes frescas\\r\\n\\r\\nCambios de peso (a menudo pÃ©rdida)\\r\\n\\r\\nCambios en los grupos de amigos\\r\\n\\r\\nAislamiento\\r\\n\\r\\nDificultad para comunicarse\\r\\n\\r\\nFalta de motivaciÃ³n\\r\\n\\r\\nCambios en la asistencia y/o desempeÃ±o escolar\\r\\n\\r\\nComportamiento agresivo\\r\\n\\r\\nDesobediencia inusual\\r\\n\\r\\nCambios de apariencia\\r\\n\\r\\nNiveles de energÃ\\xada mÃ¡s bajos (o tal vez inusualmente mÃ¡s altos)\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidencia de parafernalia de drogas\\r\\n\\r\\nDadas las razones comunes detrÃ¡s del uso indebido de opioides, la forma en que evitamos que los estudiantes Â«sufran ese dolorÂ» es crucial, dijo Green.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusque ayuda al problema de los opioides recetados\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Los servicios para el abuso de sustancias y la salud mental en este paÃ\\xads no estÃ¡n donde deberÃ\\xadan estarÂ», asegurÃ³ Green. Pero hay cierto apoyo disponible, independientemente de la capacidad de pago. Los padres y los adolescentes de EE.UU. pueden llamar al 211 para obtener informaciÃ³n sobre los recursos locales. Algunas escuelas tienen centros de salud que ofrecen servicios de apoyo para el uso indebido o abuso de sustancias.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos padres deben comunicar cualquier inquietud al pediatra de su hijo o llevar a su hijo a un mÃ©dico de salud del comportamiento si el niÃ±o estÃ¡ dispuesto, dijo GonzÃ¡lez.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEmpieza hablando con tu hijo, y ni siquiera tienes que empezar con â\\x80\\x98Me preocupan las drogasâ\\x80\\x99. Es â\\x80\\x98Estoy preocupado por ti. Â¿EstÃ¡s bien?'Â», agregÃ³.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos adolescentes que se sienten conectados con sus familias y escuelas tienen un riesgo menor de consumir sustancias y suicidarse, dijo Wilkins. Los padres pueden facilitar la conexiÃ³n comunicÃ¡ndose honesta y abiertamente sobre temas delicados y respetando y considerando las opiniones, pensamientos y sentimientos de los adolescentes. Â«Cuando haya un conflicto, sea claro acerca de las metas y las expectativasÂ», aÃ±adiÃ³ Wilkins. Â«Pero permite la opiniÃ³n de tu (adolescente) sobre cÃ³mo alcanzar esas metasÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nLos padres deben facilitar la toma de decisiones saludables y al mismo tiempo alentar a sus hijos a tomar sus propias decisiones, dijo Wilkins. Conocer a los amigos de tu adolescente, disfrutar de actividades compartidas y comprometerse con la escuela del adolescente tambiÃ©n puede ayudar.\\r\\n\\r\\nSi usted o alguien que conoce estÃ¡ luchando con pensamientos suicidas o problemas de salud mental, llame a la LÃ\\xadnea Nacional de PrevenciÃ³n del Suicidio al 1-800-273-8255 para comunicarse con un consejero capacitado o visite el sitio de NSPL.\",\n",

Pero no te dejes engaÃ±ar, el Dot es un dispositivo Alexa capaz que es lo suficientemente pequeÃ±o como para ponerlo en casi cualquier superficie, ya sea una mesa de noche junto a tu cama o una esquina del mostrador de tu cocina. Hay un anillo LED que gira alrededor de la parte superior, lo que te permite saber cuÃ¡ndo Alexa te estÃ¡ escuchando.

No es lo suficientemente grande o potente como para llenar una habitaciÃ³n grande, pero hace un trabajo fantÃ¡stico en un Ã¡rea mÃ¡s pequeÃ±a como un baÃ±o. Hay un conector de audio de 3,5 mm en la parte posterior, que te permite conectar una bocina estÃ¡ndar, y tal vez mÃ¡s potente, al Dot.

En lugar de un disco de hockey, Amazon diseÃ±Ã³ una nueva experiencia Echo que se parece mÃ¡s a una pelota de tenis. El diseÃ±o en forma de esfera tiene una cubierta de tela que ocupa la mayor parte del Ã¡rea visible, dÃ¡ndole al punto un aspecto refinado que se mezclarÃ¡ con los muebles de tu hogar o apartamento.

Al igual que con el resto de la lÃ\\xadnea Show, hay un conector de audio de 3,5 mm, un interruptor fÃ\\xadsico para desactivar el micrÃ³fono y la cÃ¡mara, y obtienes acceso completo al catÃ¡logo completo de habilidades de Alexa. El Echo Show 5 viene en carbÃ³n o arenisca.\\r\\n\\r\\nEcho Show 10 (3a generaciÃ³n) (MX$ 6.699; amazon.com.mx)\\r\\n\\r\\nEl miembro mÃ¡s reciente de la familia Echo Show es el Echo Show 10. Es diferente a cualquier otro Echo Show que hayamos visto antes, en lugar de una pantalla estacionaria, la pantalla del Show 10 en realidad gira y te sigue por la habitaciÃ³n durante una videollamada con la cÃ¡mara de 13 megapÃ\\xadxeles o mientras ves un programa. No solo se mueve para mantenerte en el encuadre durante una llamada, sino que se moverÃ¡ contigo mientras caminas por la habitaciÃ³n. Es un poco espeluznante, pero genial.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl diseÃ±o es una mezcla de modelos anteriores de Echo Show, combinados con el nuevo diseÃ±o de Echo. Es decir, es una pantalla que se encuentra sobre una base esfÃ©rica. La base gira a medida que te mueves, manteniendo la pantalla y los altavoces siempre mirando a quien estÃ© en la habitaciÃ³n. Eso significa que puedes pedir ver una transmisiÃ³n de cÃ¡mara de video de tu hijo durmiendo y no tener que preocuparse por llevar una tableta adicional solo para vigilarlos. La calidad del sonido tambiÃ©n es excelente, lo que le da al Echo Show 10 mÃ¡s versatilidad cuando se combina con la pantalla clara de 10,1 pulgadas. Puedes recoger el Echo Show 10 en carbÃ³n o blanco glaciar por 249,99 MX$.\\r\\n\\r\\nEcho Studio (MX$ 4.499; amazon.com.mx)\\r\\n\\r\\nSi los altavoces Echo te dejan con ganas de mÃ¡s, entonces Echo Studio de Amazon estÃ¡ hecho para ti. Es la primera y Ãºnica bocina de Amazon que admite formatos de audio HD y 3D como Dolby Atmos, y suena genial. El Studio llena cualquier habitaciÃ³n de su casa con sonido, y cuando reproduce archivos de audio compatibles, tiene un escenario de sonido muy amplio, con efecto 3D. Puedes escuchar mientras el sonido se mueve a travÃ©s de tu habitaciÃ³n, a pesar de que solo hay una bocina. AdemÃ¡s de la gran calidad de sonido, el Studio funciona como un centro para el hogar inteligente con conectividad Zigbee y Alexa integrada. Es mucho mÃ¡s grande, comparativamente al menos, que otros dispositivos Echo, por lo que querrÃ¡s asegurarte de tener un lugar dedicado en un estante o soporte de TV para Ã©l. Hablando de televisiÃ³n, puedes conectar el Studio a un Amazon Fire TV compatible y usarlo como bocina de salida, o emparejar dos Echo Studio para un sonido aÃºn mÃ¡s grande.\\r\\n\\r\\nEcho Sub (MX$ 3.800,10; amazon.com.mx)\\r\\n\\r\\nEl Echo Sub no ofrece ninguna de las caracterÃ\\xadsticas de Alexa que tiene el resto de la lÃ\\xadnea Echo de Amazon. Ni siquiera tiene micrÃ³fono, sino que estÃ¡ destinado a actuar como un subwoofer para cualquiera de sus dispositivos Echo. Su intenciÃ³n principal es conectarse con Echo Studio para completar toda la experiencia de sonido envolvente, pero no dejes que eso le impida hacerte con uno. FuncionarÃ¡ con Echo Dot 4a GeneraciÃ³n, Echo Dot 3a GeneraciÃ³n, Eco 4a GeneraciÃ³n, Eco 3a GeneraciÃ³n, Eco 2a GeneraciÃ³n, Echo Show 10 3a GeneraciÃ³n y Echo Plus 2a GeneraciÃ³n. En resumen, el Echo Sub es un dispositivo adicional que completarÃ¡ tu experiencia Echo si estÃ¡s escuchando mucha mÃºsica en tu(s) Echo(s) y quieres mejorar la experiencia general.\\r\\n\\r\\nNota: Los precios anteriores reflejan el precio en el momento de la publicaciÃ³n del artÃ\\xadculo.',\n",

(CrÃ©dito: CorporaciÃ³n de Montaje Orbital)\\r\\n\\r\\nUn hotel como ningÃºn otro\\r\\n\\r\\nLas representaciones de cÃ³mo podrÃ\\xada verse el hotel sugieren un interior no muy diferente a un hotel de lujo en la Tierra, solo que con algunas vistas bastante especiales.\\r\\n\\r\\nCuando se estrenaron los diseÃ±os iniciales hace un par de aÃ±os, Tim Alatorre, arquitecto de diseÃ±o senior de Orbital Assembly Corporation le dijo a CNN Travel que la estÃ©tica del hotel era una respuesta directa a la pelÃ\\xadcula de Stanley Kubrick Â«2001: A Space OdysseyÂ», a la que llamÃ³ Â«casi un plan de lo que no se debe hacerÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Creo que el objetivo de Stanley Kubrick era resaltar la divisiÃ³n entre tecnologÃ\\xada y humanidad, por lo que, a propÃ³sito, hizo que las estaciones y las naves fueran muy estÃ©riles, limpias y extraÃ±asÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nEn cambio, Alatorre y su equipo quieren llevar un trozo de tierra al espacio a travÃ©s de cÃ¡lidas suites y elegantes bares y restaurantes. Los huÃ©spedes pueden estar en el espacio, pero aÃºn pueden disfrutar de camas y duchas normales.\\r\\n\\r\\nEso no quiere decir que el hotel ignorarÃ¡ por completo la novedad de estar en el espacio. Hay planes para servir Â«comida espacialÂ» tradicional, como helado liofilizado, en el restaurante del hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdemÃ¡s, se ofrecerÃ¡n actividades recreativas que Â«resaltan el hecho de que puedes hacer cosas que no puedes hacer en la TierraÂ», segÃºn Alatorre.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Debido a la ingravidez y la gravedad reducida, podrÃ¡s saltar mÃ¡s alto, podrÃ¡s levantar cosas, podrÃ¡s correr de maneras que no puedes en la TierraÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¿CÃ³mo funciona?\\r\\n\\r\\nEntonces, Â¿cÃ³mo funcionarÃ\\xada exactamente la fÃ\\xadsica de un hotel espacial?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlatorre le dijo a CNN Travel que la rueda giratoria funcionarÃ\\xada para crear una gravedad simulada.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«La estaciÃ³n gira, empujando el contenido de la estaciÃ³n hacia el perÃ\\xadmetro de la estaciÃ³n, de la misma manera que se puede hacer girar un balde de agua sin regarla: el agua sale dentro del balde y permanece en su lugarÂ», dijo.\\r\\n\\r\\nCerca del centro de la estaciÃ³n no hay gravedad artificial, explicÃ³ Alatorre, pero a medida que avanza por el exterior de la estaciÃ³n, la sensaciÃ³n de gravedad aumenta.\\r\\n\\r\\nSe eligiÃ³ el nombre original del hotel porque el concepto se inspirÃ³ en diseÃ±os de 60 aÃ±os de Wernher von Braun, un ingeniero aeroespacial que fue pionero en la tecnologÃ\\xada de cohetes, primero en Alemania y luego en Estados Unidos.\\r\\n\\r\\nMientras vivÃ\\xada en Alemania, von Braun participÃ³ en el programa de desarrollo de cohetes nazi, por lo que nombrar el hotel espacial en su honor fue una elecciÃ³n controvertida.\\r\\n\\r\\nEsta fue en parte la razÃ³n por la que se cambiÃ³ el nombre, dijo Blincow a CNN Travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«La estaciÃ³n no se trata realmente de Ã©l. Se basa en su diseÃ±o y nos gustan sus contribuciones a la ciencia y el espacioÂ», dijo Blincow. Â«Pero ya sabes, Voyager Station es mucho mÃ¡s que eso. Es el material en el futuro. Y queremos un nombre que no tenga esos adjuntosÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nEl turismo espacial se estÃ¡ convirtiendo en un tema cada vez mÃ¡s candente, y hay varias empresas que intentan hacerlo realidad, desde Virgin Galactic hasta SpaceX de Elon Musk.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl sistema StarShip de SpaceX podrÃ\\xada ayudar a despegar la estaciÃ³n Voyager.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«No podemos llamar a SpaceX nuestro socio, pero en el futuro esperamos trabajar con ellosÂ», dijo Blincow en un evento en vivo reciente que promociona Orbital Assembly, aconsejando a los espectadores que Â«esperenÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nPor ahora, el hotel espacial no estÃ¡ anunciando una tarifa de habitaciÃ³n, pero espera que tenga un precio bastante elevado adjunto.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgin Galactic, por ejemplo, planea lanzar pasajeros al espacio suborbital a US$ 250.000 por persona, por viaje.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin embargo, el equipo detrÃ¡s de la estaciÃ³n Voyager ha dicho que esperan que eventualmente una estadÃ\\xada en el hotel sea equivalente a Â«un viaje en un crucero o un viaje a DisneylandÂ».\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«Cultura de naves espacialesÂ»\\r\\n\\r\\nSi bien la estaciÃ³n Voyager es quizÃ¡s el diseÃ±o mÃ¡s llamativo de Orbital, en realidad es solo una faceta de sus ambiciones espaciales.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl equipo tambiÃ©n espera construir estaciones de investigaciÃ³n y generar oportunidades comerciales y de turismo espacial.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ«En este momento estamos diseÃ±ando las herramientas y mÃ¡quinas que pueden construir estas estructuras muy rÃ¡pidamenteÂ», dijo Blincow a CNN Travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl equipo imagina que el gobierno o las empresas privadas podrÃ\\xadan usar mÃ³dulos para capacitar a las tripulaciones Â«que se dirigen a Marte, la Luna y mÃ¡s allÃ¡Â», como Alatorre describiÃ³ en el evento en vivo de 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa siguiente etapa para hacer despegar la Voyager Station es atraer a mÃ¡s inversores a la mezcla y continuar con las pruebas en el terreno.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl objetivo final, como Alatorre lo expresÃ³ en 2019, es Â«crear una cultura de naves estelares en la que las personas vayan al espacio, vivan en el espacio, trabajen en el espacio y quieran estar en el espacio. Y creemos que hay un demanda para eso Â«.',\n",

Fue escogida por Oprah Winfrey para su Book Club. Lo leÃ\\xad a los 12 o 13 aÃ±os y fue maravilloso.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Buenos dÃ\\xadas, tristeza: un libro que rompiÃ³ moldes\\r\\n\\r\\nUna de mis autoras superfavoritas â\\x80\\x93la francesa FranÃ§oise Saganâ\\x80\\x93 revolucionÃ³ el mundo en 1954 con su atrevida Buenos dÃ\\xadas, tristeza, seguida de la novela Una cierta sonrisa.

Lo que los hombres nunca saben\\r\\n\\r\\nLa austriaca Vicki Baum es la autora de la muy romÃ¡ntica (Â¡y realista!) novela Lo que los hombres nunca saben, que me marcÃ³ profundamente â\\x80\\x93y me hizo llorarâ\\x80\\x93desde la adolescencia. La Baum escribiÃ³ muchas novelas que tienen lugar en hoteles â\\x80\\x93como con su fascinante Grand Hotel (no confundir con Hotel Shangai)â\\x80\\x93 y fueron llevadas al cine.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Rebecca\\r\\n\\r\\nDaphne du Maurier fue una autora inglesa de comienzos del siglo XX que nos dejÃ³ libros claves â\\x80\\x93y misteriosos â\\x80\\x9cthrillersâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x93, como Rebecca y Los pÃ¡jaros. Ambos han sido llevados al cine y asÃ\\xad se hizo muy conocida su obra. Alfred Hitchcock dirigiÃ³ la inolvidable Rebecca en 1940, con Laurence Olivier y Joan Fontaine. Un libro que me encantÃ³ y he leÃ\\xaddo varias veces.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Mujercitas, de Louisa May Alcott\\r\\n\\r\\nLlevada de nuevo al cine en 2019, es un libro muy tierno, que promueve el amor entre hermanas y es ideal para leer en casa, â\\x80\\x9cen familiaâ\\x80\\x9d. QuizÃ¡s sea un poco â\\x80\\x9canticuadoâ\\x80\\x9d para las nuevas generaciones, pero es perfecto para quien ama las tradiciones de toda la vida.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Lo que el viento se llevÃ³, de Margaret Mitchell\\r\\n\\r\\nEl gran libro en el que basÃ³ el famoso film es otro clÃ¡sico que narra la saga de una familia sureÃ±a en medio de la Guerra Civil estadounidense. Yo he visto el film como 10 veces al menos, pues es superromÃ¡ntico. Scarlett Oâ\\x80\\x99Hara era una consentida, malcriada, pero muy bella y coqueta â\\x80\\x93y el personaje de Rhett Butler ha enamorado a millones de mujeres en el mundo Â¡hasta el dÃ\\xada de hoy!â\\x80\\x93.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. DÃ©sirÃ©eâ\\x80¦ y las aventuras de Amber\\r\\n\\r\\nLas novelas histÃ³ricas romÃ¡nticas siempre me han gustado, y DÃ©sirÃ©e, de Annemarie Selinko, es uno de mis libros favoritos (lo he leÃ\\xaddo varias veces) sobre la vida novelada (y muy romÃ¡ntica) de DÃ©sirÃ©e Clary, prometida de NapolÃ©on. Novia, quien, por giros de la historia, aÃ±os mÃ¡s tarde serÃ\\xada reina de Suecia, Â¡pues junto a su marido el mariscal del ejÃ©rcito napoleÃ³nico â\\x80\\x93Jean-Baptiste Bernanotteâ\\x80\\x93fundÃ³ la actual Casa Real de Suecia! Â¡Te va a encantar! Y Marlon Brando hace de NapoleÃ³n junto a Jean Simmons en la romÃ¡ntica versiÃ³n para el cine.\\r\\n\\r\\nY si buscas sensualidad e historia, Por siempre Ã\\x81mbar, una novela supersexi y divertida, es sobre una cortesana inglesa del siglo XVII, llamada Amber St Clare â\\x80\\x93de la autora estadounidense Kathleen Winsor â\\x80\\x93, fue un inmediato best seller cuando se publicÃ³ en 1944, al final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Â¡cuando el pÃºblico aparentemente anhelaba libros light y sexy!\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Â¡Tres de mis favoritas autoras latinoamericanas!\\r\\n\\r\\nMuchos de los libros de nuevas voces e iconos de nuestra literatura han sido llevados al cine. PermÃ\\xadteme que escoja tres libros y tres autoras como el nÃºmero 9 de mi selecciÃ³n, Â¡porque me es difÃ\\xadcil escoger tan solo uno! Ellas son:\\r\\n\\r\\nLa cubana exilada en ParÃ\\xads -y multipremiada- ZoÃ© ValdÃ©s tiene entre muchos libros dos obras maravillosas: La nada cotidiana y Te di la vida entera. Entre mis libros favoritos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabel Allende con La casa de los espÃ\\xadritus y Paula. Una escritora peruana de nacimiento y chilena de crianza totalmente genial.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura Esquivel es la fabulosa autora mexicana de Como agua para chocolate (â\\x80\\x9cLike Water for Chocolateâ\\x80\\x9d) publicada en mÃ¡s de 35 idiomas Â¡y cuyo film es un encanto!\\r\\n\\r\\nOtras autoras hispanas que te recomiendo: a) Elena Poniatowska y su libro La noche de Tlatelolco son un must. La mexicana-francesa autora fue Premio Cervantes 2013. b) Sandra Cisneros â\\x80\\x93nacida en Chicago, de origen mexicanoâ\\x80\\x93 saltÃ³ a la fama con su fabulosa y premiada La Casa en Mango Street. c) Ana Merino â\\x80\\x93Premio Nadal 2020â\\x80\\x93 y su nueva y fascinante novela El mapa de los afectos. d) Julia Ã\\x81lvarez, dominicana criada en Estados Unidos, es autora de De cÃ³mo las muchachas GarcÃ\\xada perdieron el acento y del extraordinario libro En el tiempo de las mariposas. Â¡No te los pierdas!\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Los mundos de Jane Austen y de Edith Wharton\\r\\n\\r\\nLas novelas de la autora inglesa Jane Austen (1775-1817) son clÃ¡sicos de la literatura y una ventana al mundo fascinante de la Inglaterra del siglo XVIII, con sus costumbres, reglas y prejuicios. En ellas conoceremos personajes inolvidables y muchos finales sorprendentes. Te recomiendo conocerla, leyendo: Emma, Amor y Amistad (â\\x80\\x9cLove and Friendshipâ\\x80\\x9d), Orgullo y prejuicio (â\\x80\\x9cPride and Prejudiceâ\\x80\\x9d), Sensatez y sentimientos (â\\x80\\x9cSense and Sensibilityâ\\x80\\x9d) y Mansfield Park. Muchas de sus obras han sido llevadas al cine y el teatro. Otra autora que me encanta es Edith Wharton â\\x80\\x93siglo XIX y comienzos del XXâ\\x80\\x93, genial novelista estadounidense cuyas novelas mostraban las luchas de las mujeres por la igualdad. Y si tan solo te lees el libro (y ves el film) La edad de la inocencia (â\\x80\\x9cThe Age of Innocenceâ\\x80\\x9d) me darÃ¡s la razÃ³n.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Â¿Te gusta lo gÃ³tico y el misterio?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMary Shelleyâ\\x80\\x99s Frankensteinâ\\x80\\x9d es ejemplo perfecto de novela gÃ³tica, igual que las novelas de Victoria Holt, el pseudÃ³nimo de Eleanor Hibbert (me encantan) â\\x80\\x93y los libros detectivescos de Agatha Christieâ\\x80\\x93. Â¡Y en Ã©pocas recientes no me pierdo los misterios de Susan Kiernan-Lewis que tienen lugar en la Provenza!\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Poetisas y filÃ³sofas\\r\\n\\r\\nLas mujeres dedicadas a la literatura profunda, con poesÃ\\xada o ensayos literarios, vienen de todas partes del mundo: poetisas como la chilena Gabriela Mistral, las argentinas Alfonsina Storni y Silvina Ocampo, y la maravillosa cubana Gertrudis GÃ³mez de Avellaneda. Ensayos y diarios de la cubana residente en ParÃ\\xads Anais Nin y de la icÃ³nica feminista Simone de Beauvoir. Sin olvidar las tristes realidades de autoras como Sylvia Plath â\\x80\\x93y en EspaÃ±a la amplia obra de Emilia Pardo BazÃ¡n, pionera de la literatura del siglo XIX y gran feminista y mujer â\\x80\\x9cliberadaâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x93 igual que en el siglo XX lo han sido feministas como Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedman â\\x80\\x93Â¡y la superfamosa Virginia Woolf!â\\x80\\x93.\\r\\n\\r\\nUna idea que me encanta, ahora que tienen mi lista â\\x80\\x93y he comentado antesâ\\x80\\x93 es recomendarles que su propio Club del Libro. Algo que â\\x80\\x93a travÃ©s de Zoom o de FaceTime â\\x80\\x93 pueden compartir con familia y amigas. Â¿Por quÃ© no? SerÃ\\xada algo encantador que les va a entretener y deleitar.',\n",

Â¡La creaciÃ³n de un supernegocio universal!\\r\\n\\r\\nCardin tambiÃ©n creÃ³ la venta de licencias, para que se pudiera usar su nombre en todo tipo de productos -desde ropa femenina y masculina, hasta gafas, vajillas, autos y muebles. Y numerosas fÃ¡bricas de todo el mundo manufacturaban sus creaciones. Muy pronto, otras marcas comenzaron a imitarlo y nacieron cientos de logos que ansiosos consumidores de todo el planeta comenzamos a usar en camisetas, bolsos, perfumes y otros artÃ\\xadculos â\\x80\\x93 y que nos hacÃ\\xadan sentir importantes, cool y muy a la moda. Â¡Y las licencias de todo tipo se multiplicaron en el mundo!\\r\\n\\r\\nTodo esto sin olvidar su sentido de que la moda es universal, y para ello Cardin organizÃ³ dramÃ¡ticos desfiles de moda en lugares donde ningÃºn diseÃ±ador habÃ\\xada ido antes, como la Plaza Roja de MoscÃº Â¡y la Gran Muralla China!\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¿QuiÃ©n era Pierre Cardin?\\r\\n\\r\\nMuy adelantado a su tiempo, desde niÃ±o Cardin vivÃ\\xada fascinado por el misterio del espacio y otros planetas â\\x80\\x93 y su ropa mostraba ese amor con creaciones que chocaban a muchos. Su gran aprendizaje en el mundo de la alta costura, trabajando varios aÃ±os como asistente del superrespetado Christian Dior, le dieron la ventaja de conocer la calidad y los cortes perfectos de la ropa. Y esa base de conocimiento lo distinguiÃ³ entre otros. Â¡Cardin sabÃ\\xada cortar y coser, y lo suyo iba mucho mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de un fabuloso diseÃ±o!\\r\\n\\r\\nY enseguida, este joven nacido en Venecia en 1922 -criado en Saint Etienne y quien hizo su carrera en ParÃ\\xads, donde su familia habÃ\\xada emigrado-, puso su sello en la forma como nos vestimos a partir de 1950, al independizarse como creador, crear su propia marca y lanzar diseÃ±os futuristas para hombres y mujeres en telas y estilos muy novedosos.\\r\\n\\r\\nUna carrera que continuÃ³ llamando la atenciÃ³n cuando los hombres comenzaron a usar sus exÃ³ticas chaquetas Nehru, que imitaban los trajes de hombre en la India -y se hizo una tendencia tan popular que pronto la usaban tambiÃ©n las mujeres, creando una nueva moda unisex. Y el difÃ\\xadcil mundo de la moda -fascinado con Cardin- Â¡declarÃ³ que habÃ\\xada nacido una leyenda!\\r\\n\\r\\nEran aÃ±os en que la competencia entre diseÃ±adores era feroz y todos querÃ\\xadan ser los mÃ¡s famosos y mejores. Y Cardin creÃ³ modelos y accesorios que parecÃ\\xadan ideales para un viaje al espacio (la colecciÃ³n se llamaba Cosmocorps) â\\x80\\x94 igual que ropa para las sexy heroÃ\\xadnas de los films de James Bond, que eran la locura.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuve la suerte de conocerlo y conversar largamente con Ã©l en varias ocasiones a travÃ©s de los aÃ±os y â\\x80\\x94comiendo en ParÃ\\xads, en el famoso restaurante Maximâ\\x80\\x99s de su propiedadâ\\x80\\x94 el muy conversador Cardin me contÃ³ de los muchos sueÃ±os y planes que todavÃ\\xada tenÃ\\xada. Me di cuenta que cumplir aÃ±os no lo detenÃ\\xada -y ya en sus 90 seguÃ\\xada inventando con entusiasmo.\\r\\n\\r\\nY recuerdo que fue muy divertido reÃ\\xadrnos cuando le contÃ© que todavÃ\\xada usaba bolsos de su creaciÃ³n -de 30 aÃ±os atrÃ¡s â\\x80\\x93 que me seguÃ\\xadan encantando y que eran como mis buenos amigos.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lo que Cardin me dijo â\\x80\\x9cÂ¿Amigos? Noâ\\x80¦ son parte de ti, de tu familia, de tu recuerdo y de tu futuro. Â¡Y esa es mi intenciÃ³n cuando los creo!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBravo, Pierre Cardin. Y gracias.',\n",

Y motivo de gran controversia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMIRA: El prÃ\\xadncipe Harry y Meghan hacen una donaciÃ³n tras tormenta invernal\\r\\n\\r\\nLo he comentado con muchas amigas y personas expertas en la realeza â\\x80\\x93 y encuentro muchas opiniones encontradas e incluso gran pasiÃ³n en sus apreciaciones sobre Meghan.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonalmente ya no sÃ© ni quÃ© pensar -y me siento muy confundida. A mÃ\\xad me encantaba Meghan -e incluso visitÃ© Londres y el Castillo de Windsor dos veces â\\x80\\x93para ver antes del evento la capilla de St George donde se celebrÃ³ la boda de Meghan y Harry el 19 de mayo de 2018. Â¡QuerÃ\\xada saber todos los detalles y escribir sobre ello!\\r\\n\\r\\nMe gustaba que Harry se hubiera enamorado de una mujer inteligente, orgullosa de su herencia negra, trabajadora, simpatizante de la ecologÃ\\xada y de ayudar a los desfavorecidos. Y ella -actriz (de una teleserie no precisamente superconocida) divorciada y aparentemente muy ambiciosa en su vida profesional- se habÃ\\xada enamorado locamente de un prÃ\\xadncipe pelirrojo que hasta entonces habÃ\\xada vivido una inestable vida amorosa con sucesivas novias rubias y de familias ricas, aunque siempre aÃ±orando sus viajes a Ã\\x81frica para ayudar a diferentes ONG, luchando con sus problemas emocionales.\\r\\n\\r\\nY aunque Meghan ha dicho que ella no seguÃ\\xada la vida de los Â«royalsÂ» -y no conocÃ\\xada detalles de la familia real inglesa- en una â\\x80\\x9ccita a ciegasâ\\x80\\x9d en julio de 2016, organizada por una amiga en comÃºn -Â¡conociÃ³ a Harry y encontrÃ³ el amor!

DespuÃ©s de muchos viajes entre Toronto (donde Meghan vivÃ\\xada) y Londres, en noviembre de 2017 se anunciaba el compromiso y la boda.\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¡Y la gran mayorÃ\\xada de los britÃ¡nicos y de medio mundo se fascinaron con la pareja y su apasionado amor y evidente compenetraciÃ³n! Â¡El amor llegaba de nuevo a la corona inglesa y el segundo de los hijos de la princesa Diana era feliz!\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¿Y quÃ© pasÃ³ despuÃ©s?\\r\\n\\r\\nHasta entonces todo era color de rosa â\\x80\\x93 y la mayorÃ\\xada de la prensa inglesa era â\\x80\\x9cfanâ\\x80\\x9d de Meghan. Me consta porque leÃ\\xada diariamente artÃ\\xadculos y notas muy positivas. Y la reina Isabel acogiÃ³ al matrimonio con enorme cariÃ±o y alegrÃ\\xada. Â¡Harry es uno de sus nietos mÃ¡s queridos y verlo feliz era una gran dicha!\\r\\n\\r\\nPero pronto aparecieron rumores de que supuestamente empleados que llevaban aÃ±os trabajando para la familia real habÃ\\xadan renunciado a trabajar con los Sussex. Nueve empleados se fueron en solo 18 meses, segÃºn cifras compiladas por The Sun- muchos con una reputaciÃ³n excelente, incluyendo a Natalie Campbell, quien renunciÃ³ a su puesto en la Sussex Royal Foundation, donde trabajaba hombro con hombro con Meghan, para ser CEO de una empresa de agua.\\r\\n\\r\\nMÃ¡s rumores se comenzaron a escuchar de que Meghan no se llevaba bien con su concuÃ±ada Kate, la esposa de William y una de las favoritas en la familia. SegÃºn una fuente cercana a las dos mujeres, â\\x80\\x9ces solo clickbaitâ\\x80\\x9d, es decir, carnada para que la gente haga clic en la historia. SegÃºn fuentes de CNN, si bien las dos mujeres no pasan mucho tiempo juntas tienen una relaciÃ³n amistosa. En un evento en 2018, los prÃ\\xadncipes Harry y William dijeron que si habÃ\\xada algÃºn desacuerdo en realidad era entre los hermanos, y no entre sus esposas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMIRA: Harry y Meghan no volverÃ¡n a ser miembros activos de la familia real\\r\\n\\r\\nY aquÃ\\xad y allÃ¡ parecÃ\\xada que Meghan no se sentÃ\\xada a gusto y pensaba que no la trataban como ella deseaba. El panorama habÃ\\xada cambiado 180 grados y pronto la duquesa de Sussex ya no parecÃ\\xada ser tan querida por la prensa y las redes sociales donde eran comunes las ofensas y el abuso verbal hacia Meghan Markle.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos escÃ¡ndalos causados por el padre y los hermanos de Meghan no ayudaron a la situaciÃ³n y los tabloides y los programas de TV en los que aparecieron se dieron gusto reportÃ¡ndolos. Algunos medios, sin duda, abusaron de la libertad que disfruta en el Reino Unido y de la noche a la maÃ±ana se fue agriando la percepciÃ³n pÃºblica de la nueva pareja.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespuÃ©s del nacimiento de Archie, Meghan se quejÃ³ en un documental sobre su viaje a Australia para la TV de que nadie le preguntaba nunca â\\x80\\x9cÂ¿Y tÃº cÃ³mo estÃ¡s? Â¿CÃ³mo te sientes?â\\x80\\x9d y hablÃ³ de las presiones de ser una nueva madre y reciÃ©n casada bajo el escrutinio pÃºblico.\\r\\n\\r\\nY muy pronto todo se enredÃ³ y como una bola de nieve que comienza a rodar, la prensa lo hizo todo muy feo. Â¡Demasiado feo! En enero de 2020, los Sussex anunciaron (sin avisar antes a la reina) que dejarÃ\\xadan de ser parte activa de la familia real â\\x80\\x93 y se mudaban a Estados Unidos. Â¡Y asÃ\\xad ocurriÃ³!\\r\\n\\r\\nEn febrero de 2020 su nuevo website Sussex Royal -que establecieron privadamente- tuvo que cambiar de nombre porque la corona inglesa de pronto se los prohibiÃ³ usar. Y asÃ\\xad ocurrieron muchos mÃ¡s contratiempos.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdelantando el reloj -ya viviendo en California y ademÃ¡s de participar en obras de caridad en la zona, los duques de Sussex no dejan de ser noticia aÃºn en medio de la pandemia del covid-19. Viven con su hijo en una gran mansiÃ³n en la zona de Santa Barbara y ahora esperan su segundo hijo. TambiÃ©n han firmado un contrato millonario con Netflix para producir documentales y programas de TV, un â\\x80\\x9cdealâ\\x80\\x9d comercial con Spotify- y hace poco Meghan invirtiÃ³ en una compaÃ±Ã\\xada ecolÃ³gica de cafÃ© -Â¡la que su vecina la famosa Oprah Winfrey ya ha endosado pÃºblicamente! SerÃ¡ Oprah quien el 7 de marzo le harÃ¡ a la pareja una entrevista estilo â\\x80\\x9ctell allâ\\x80\\x9d (sin tapujos) en la TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nAunque dicen que quieren ser anÃ³nimos, los Sussex siguen siendo gran noticia. Y hace meses Meghan escribiÃ³ un dramÃ¡tico y sorpresivo editorial para The New York Times -donde revelÃ³ que en el verano boreal habÃ\\xadan perdido un bebÃ© debido a un aborto espontÃ¡neo. Y ahora -como todos sabemos- en pocos meses llegarÃ¡ un segundo bebÃ© a la familia. Â¿Y cÃ³mo nos enteramos? Â¡Porque los Sussex emiten continuos comunicados de prensa!\\r\\n\\r\\nUn viaje por Navidad planeado al Reino Unido no ocurriÃ³ debido a la pandemia -y de acuerdo con lo reportado por Us Weekly en 2020, Doria, la madre de Meghan vive cerca de ellos y pasa mÃ¡s tiempo que antes con los Sussex. SegÃºn le dijo el biÃ³grafo real Sean Smith a la revista britÃ¡nica Fabulous, la pareja sigue en contacto con la reina y afirma que disfrutan mostrarle cuÃ¡nto ha crecido Archie desde que se mudaron del Reino Unido.\\r\\n\\r\\nTodo lo sucedido ha causado en ese paÃ\\xads-y entre los seguidores de la realeza- opiniones muy diversas y comentarios que culpan a Meghan de separar a Harry de su familia y su mundo -Â¡comparÃ¡ndola con lo que hizo en 1936 la estadounidense divorciada Wallis Simpson, por quien el rey Eduardo VIII renunciÃ³ al trono!\\r\\n\\r\\nPor otro lado, muchos aplauden que los duques de Sussex se hayan â\\x80\\x9cliberadoâ\\x80\\x9d del protocolo y quieran ser felices a su manera. Dicen que Harry echa de menos a sus compaÃ±eros del EjÃ©rcito y su mundo. Y ahora -despuÃ©s de que la reina les quitara a ambos el patrocinio oficial de muchas organizaciones- la situaciÃ³n es peor. SegÃºn la reina Isabel no se puede representar a la corona a medio tiempo o â\\x80\\x9cpart timeâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtros auguran que sus vidas no serÃ¡n tan perfectas como ellos quieren Â¡y hasta existen especulaciones sobre el futuro de esta pareja!\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¡Yo no sÃ© quÃ© pensar! Pero lo cierto es que -de momento- Meghan y Harry son y seguirÃ¡n siendo noticia â\\x80\\x93 y junto a detractores igual que sus admiradores- no hemos oÃ\\xaddo ni la mitad de esta historia, que comenzÃ³ como un cuento de hadas y quizÃ¡s ha ido perdiendo la magia.',\n",

En aquel entonces, el presidente de MÃ©xico, Vicente Fox le propuso a su homÃ³logo George W. Bush un acuerdo migratorio entre sus dos paÃ\\xadses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbarcarÃ\\xada la legalizaciÃ³n del estatus inmigratorio de los mexicanos sin papeles en Estados Unidos â\\x80\\x93que estimaban en unas 6 millones de personas entonces- y la ampliaciÃ³n paulatina, pero constante, del flujo futuro de trabajadores temporales, con una opciÃ³n hacia la residencia permanente y la ciudadanÃ\\xada en el futuro. Los atentados del 11S dieron al traste con esa ambiciÃ³n.\\r\\n\\r\\nReapareciÃ³ ya como una propuesta interna estadounidense en 2006, bajo la forma de una iniciativa de los senadores Edward Kennedy y John McCain para todos los trabajadores indocumentados, con el pleno apoyo de la administraciÃ³n Bush. Nunca llegÃ³ a ser votada.\\r\\n\\r\\nMIRA: Â¿CuÃ¡ndo se aprobarÃ¡ una reforma inmigratoria en EE.UU.?\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nEn 2007, el presidente George W. Bush intentÃ³ una reforma parecida -mÃ¡s modesta- que tampoco prosperÃ³. Finalmente, la llamada Â«Pandilla de los 8Â», de acuerdo con Barack Obama, sugiriÃ³ una nueva iniciativa en 2013. Fue ratificada por el Senado, pero no pasÃ³ el filtro de la CÃ¡mara de Representantes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl costo de todos estos intentos fallidos fue el fortalecimiento draconiano de los controles en la frontera, el aumento en el nÃºmero de deportaciones de indocumentados, y la radicalizaciÃ³n de las posturas antinmigratorias del gobierno de Donald Trump.\\r\\n\\r\\nCon estos antecedentes, el presidente Joe Biden presentÃ³ la semana pasada un proyecto propio, que podrÃ¡ salir bien librado en la CÃ¡mara de Representantes, pero solo con dificultades en el Senado. Es sumamente ambiciosa y generosa, y probablemente afectarÃ\\xada -positivamente- a mÃ¡s de 11 millones de personas que llegaron del exterior y que hoy viven en EE.UU. sin un estatus legal o con un estatus ambiguo o precario.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl buscar la regularizaciÃ³n de todos aquellos que se encontraban en este paÃ\\xads sin papeles hasta el 1 de enero de 2021, de los llamados Dreamers amparados en el DACA, de los centroamericanos con Temporary Protected Status (TPS), de un nÃºmero por determinar de trabajadores agrÃ\\xadcolas temporales o estacionales, en los hechos eliminarÃ\\xada casi de un tajo a la gran mayorÃ\\xada de los inmigrantes indocumentados o semidocumentados.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo parece incluir, por ahora, disposiciones relacionadas con los flujos futuros. Esto puede ser una gran laguna o una tÃ¡ctica de negociaciÃ³n. Todos sabemos que al dÃ\\xada siguiente de una legalizaciÃ³n generalizada, entrarÃ¡ nuevamente a Estados Unidos una cantidad significativa de personas buscando trabajo desde MÃ©xico, o huyendo de la violencia y la hambruna en el TriÃ¡ngulo del Norte. La cifra puede superar los 1.000 inmigrantes mÃ¡s todos los dÃ\\xadas si tomamos en cuenta la cifra de detenciones diarias de quienes intentan cruzar la frontera. La cuestiÃ³n de fondo es si van a ingresar a Estados Unidos con autorizaciÃ³n o sin ella.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoy en dÃ\\xada, la gran mayorÃ\\xada de los trabajadores temporales que llega al paÃ\\xads con visa lo hace bajo la figura de H-2A (para labores agrÃ\\xadcolas) o H-2B (para servicios en general). Aunque el nÃºmero de estas visas expedidas â\\x80\\x93principalmente a mexicanos- ha aumentado enormemente a lo largo de los Ãºltimos 17 aÃ±os, sigue habiendo mÃ¡s gente que desea irse a Estados Unidos que el total de permisos otorgados. El aumento del cupo, por cierto, ha sido una demanda de los agricultores de Texas y California desde hace aÃ±os, que siempre ha sido bien vista por los legisladores del Partido Republicano, aunque no por los demÃ³cratas.\\r\\n\\r\\nPor eso, elevar de manera significativa la cifra de visas anuales de este tipo -a 1 millÃ³n en lugar de poco mÃ¡s de 570.000- que fue lo que se aprobÃ³ en 2019, podrÃ\\xada atraer al contingente republicano necesario para lograr la aprobaciÃ³n en el Senado. En efecto, este es el dilema principal que enfrenta la propuesta de Biden. Bajo condiciones normales, necesitarÃ\\xada 60 votos en la CÃ¡mara Alta para ratificar la propuesta. Cuenta con 50. Si no convence a 10 republicanos, dispone de dos caminos alternativos.\\r\\n\\r\\nUno consiste en recurrir al â\\x80\\x9cBudget reconciliation processâ\\x80\\x9d, o procedimiento de conciliaciÃ³n presupuestaria, que permite aprobar ciertas leyes con una mayorÃ\\xada simple de votos en el Senado. Biden, en ese caso, contarÃ\\xada con el voto de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris para llegar a los 51 si lo necesita. Pero no es seguro que las reglas del Senado lo permitan.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa otra posibilidad es proceder por partes. En lugar de buscar la legalizaciÃ³n de todos en bloque, procurar mÃ¡s bien la regularizaciÃ³n de los trabajadores â\\x80\\x9cesencialesâ\\x80\\x9d en tiempos de covid-19, de los amparados por DACA, de los que tienen TPS, de los familiares sin papeles de hijos o conyuges nacidos en Estados Unidos y de quienes caen en otras categorÃ\\xadas especiales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiden sabe que debe evitar los errores de Obama: esperar que los republicanos lo apoyen a cambio de nada -cosa que nunca van a hacer- sin darle a una decena de opositores concesiones importantes en otros temas. Sabe tambiÃ©n que el asunto es decisivo, y que debe lograr algo al respecto durante su primer aÃ±o de gobierno. Una vez aprobado el paquete de rescate de la economÃ\\xada, la reforma inmigratoria debe ser su principal objetivo. Por el bien de millones de latinoamericanos, y de cientos de millones de estadounidenses.',\n",

Por un lado la pandemia, que redujo en 2020 un 11% de su ya magro Producto Interno Bruto (PIB). Por otro, el esperado cambio de polÃ\\xadtica de Washington, para el que el presidente de Estados Unidos Joe Biden no tiene mucho apuro ni definidos horizontes y, en el medio, un pertinaz descontento interno, representado Ãºltimamente por una canciÃ³n de protesta perteneciente al raro subgÃ©nero musical del cubatÃ³n (variante cubana del reguetÃ³n, proveniente a su vez del reggae y el hip hop estadounidense).\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPatria y vidaâ\\x80\\x9d califica a la perfecciÃ³n como una canciÃ³n de protesta cubana. No serÃ¡ la primera, pero sÃ\\xad merece ser la primera en relevancia, porque dos de sus intÃ©rpretes â\\x80\\x94que son seisâ\\x80\\x94 Maykel Osorbo (Castillo) y EliÃ©cer â\\x80\\x9cEl Funkyâ\\x80\\x9d MÃ¡rquez Duany residen en Cuba, y por la amplia difusiÃ³n conseguida. AdemÃ¡s, la combativa respuesta del gobierno cubano le garantiza ese lugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nLes molesta. Y como molesta tanto, le han dado mucha publicidad denunciÃ¡ndola como anexionista, como un panfleto musical y como â\\x80\\x9cuna estrategiaâ\\x80\\x9d. La respuesta gubernamental abona la curiosidad pÃºblica por saber lo que dice la canciÃ³n. Resultado: publicidad y relevancia gratuita.\\r\\n\\r\\nPero, Â¿por quÃ© no los detienen y los condenan? Â¿SerÃ¡ porque su propia ConstituciÃ³n, aprobada hace apenas dos aÃ±os, garantiza en su artÃ\\xadculo 54 la libertad de expresiÃ³n? Por eso, tÃ©cnicamente, un gobierno no debe encarcelar a ninguno de sus ciudadanos. Los amenazan, los asustan, los golpearÃ¡n, los apresan y los sueltan, pero todos estÃ¡n, hasta ahora, libres. AsÃ\\xad es desde el allanamiento policial del Movimiento San Isidro el 26 de noviembre de 2020, las manifestaciones ante el Ministerio de Cultura de Cuba â\\x80\\x94cuyo gran error fue no entrar a la reuniÃ³n pactada del 27 de enero de 2021, a la que el viceministro de Cultura Fernando Rojas los invitÃ³ repetidamente ante las cÃ¡marasâ\\x80\\x94 y, ahora, con los creadores de la rabiosamente anticomunista canciÃ³n â\\x80\\x9cPatria y vidaâ\\x80\\x9d. Todos han retado claramente al gobierno cubano.\\r\\n\\r\\nPero es que Washington va a proceder con mucha cautela en la reapertura de las relaciones con Cuba, y meter presos a jÃ³venes por el solo delito de hablar contra el gobierno es un muy mal ejemplo de civilidad. Hay que ser pacientes y calculadores frente a la esperada benevolencia de Biden, que parece ser la Ãºnica opciÃ³n que Cuba tiene. Porque ya no hay Rusia ni Venezuela que ayuden, y se necesita la esperanzadora amistad del â\\x80\\x9cimperio del malâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nHay que reconocer que el gobierno cubano es experto en situaciones especiales, porque casi siempre ha estado en una, al igual que en situaciones difÃ\\xadciles, como ahora.\\r\\n\\r\\nY salir de esta situaciÃ³n serÃ\\xada muy sencillo: lograr el Ã©xito econÃ³mico. Que las reformas que instrumentan fueran efectivas. No solo calculadas para mantener el poder de una burocracia que lastra a la naciÃ³n. Que la economÃ\\xada sea todo lo verdaderamente soberana que puede ser. Sin depender de la benevolencia de nadie. Â¿SerÃ¡ posible? Para eso serÃ\\xada necesaria la valentÃ\\xada polÃ\\xadtica del Gobierno cubano, para acometer los cambios econÃ³micos realmente necesarios.\\r\\n\\r\\nEn apenas dos meses tendrÃ¡ lugar el VIII Congreso del Partido de Cuba. Diez aÃ±os despuÃ©s de que se planteara la necesidad de reformar la economÃ\\xada, y catorce desde que RaÃºl Castro expresara su total convicciÃ³n de que era vital â\\x80\\x9cintroducir los cambios estructurales y conceptos que resulten necesarios (â\\x80¦) con sentido crÃ\\xadtico y creador sin anquilosamientosâ\\x80\\x9d. Algo parecido dijo Fidel Castro con aquello de â\\x80\\x9ccambiar lo que deba ser cambiadoâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d. Sin embargo, no sucede, todo es incertidumbre. Grandes actos con elegantes palabras que no se concretan, solo se posponen en una nueva esperanza y otra y otra.\\r\\n\\r\\nPor eso surge â\\x80\\x9cPatria y vidaâ\\x80\\x9d, con su ritmo pegajoso y su letra clara. Â¿TendrÃ¡ algÃºn efecto en los destinos de Cuba? El gobierno cubano, acostumbrado a lo grandioso, dice que todas estas manifestaciones de jÃ³venes rebeldes no son otra cosa que parte de un â\\x80\\x9cgolpe blandoâ\\x80\\x9d organizado desde Estados Unidos. Es la Ãºltima y frÃ¡gil versiÃ³n de los hechos. Â¿UtilizarÃ¡n ese argumento para encarcelarlos? Â¿Y aceptarÃ¡n la negociaciÃ³n con un gobierno que quiere sacarlos del poder? Son las a veces tontas y siempre amargas contradicciones en que a menudo se encuentra la realidad sociopolÃ\\xadtica de la dulce Cuba.',\n",

Hoy me parece increÃ\\xadble que casi un aÃ±o despuÃ©s, desafortunadamente, nuestras vidas sigan girando alrededor de este tema. Los cambios polÃ\\xadticos en EE.UU. han sido enormes en los Ãºltimos meses y cuando llega una nueva administraciÃ³n llegan nuevas ideas, aunque a veces no sean tan buenas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUno de los retos mÃ¡s grandes que ha traÃ\\xaddo esta pandemia para los legisladores estadounidenses es, obviamente, cÃ³mo abordar el cuidado de la salud a travÃ©s de la legislaciÃ³n. Con mÃ¡s de 28 millones de contagios confirmados en Estados Unidos hasta este martes, y tras superar las 500.000 muertes segÃºn datos de la Universidad Johns Hopkins, nos enfrentamos a un largo y difÃ\\xadcil camino en nuestra lucha contra el covid-19. Actualmente se ejecuta un programa de vacunaciÃ³n masiva, pero los estadounidenses, incluida la comunidad latina, aÃºn necesitan mayor acceso a atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica asequible y de calidad.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesafortunadamente, dÃ©cadas de regulaciones y trÃ¡mites burocrÃ¡ticos federales y estatales han hecho mÃ¡s difÃ\\xadcil la atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica y, con demasiada frecuencia, demasiado costosa. No es de extraÃ±ar, entonces, que casi siempre los estadounidenses reporten una insatisfacciÃ³n constante con los servicios mÃ©dicos y los obstÃ¡culos que deben superar para obtenerlos, segÃºn una encuesta de Gallup publicada en diciembre de 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa soluciÃ³n, a mi parecer, no es, como algunos han sugerido, una opciÃ³n pÃºblica, es decir, un enfoque federal uniforme para todos los estados.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos latinos conocen bien los costos de este enfoque. En la mayorÃ\\xada de nuestros paÃ\\xadses los sistemas de salud pÃºblicos estÃ¡n azotados por una serie de problemas que pasan por la falta de recursos, la corrupciÃ³n, o la falta de calidad en los servicios prestados.\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nMIRA: Argentina tiene nueva ministra de salud, tras escÃ¡ndalo por posible Â«vacunatorio VIPÂ»\\r\\n\\r\\nEn lugar de una opciÃ³n pÃºblica, los estadounidenses necesitan una opciÃ³n personal. Para que esto sea posible, los legisladores deben liderar el camino para eliminar muchas de las barreras que impiden que los pacientes accedan a los servicios que necesitan. Los estados podrÃ\\xadan comenzar por derogar o reformar sus leyes de certificados de necesidad (â\\x80\\x9ccertificate-of-needÂ») â\\x80\\x94 que requiere que, por ejemplo, para ampliar un hospital, los hospitales busquen directamente aprobaciÃ³n del estado, que solo se la darÃ¡ si hay una Â«necesidad pÃºblica suficienteÂ» para ello.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarios estudios demuestran que estas certificaciones reducen el acceso a la atenciÃ³n medica, erosionan su calidad y aumentan su precio. No es difÃ\\xadcil ver por quÃ©. Estas leyes crean intencionalmente monopolios locales, a menudo prohibiendo a nuevos proveedores abrir sus puertas a los pacientes y restringiendo a los hospitales la compra de suministros crÃ\\xadticos, incluso camas, sin la aprobaciÃ³n de estos burÃ³cratas que forman parte de estas juntas de certificados de necesidad. Estas leyes han sido tan desastrosas durante la pandemia que 24 estados de EE.UU. optaron por suspenderlas temporalmente. AÃºn asÃ\\xad, los legisladores deberÃ\\xadan votar para derogar permanentemente estas leyes con el fin de mejorar los resultados y prepararnos para la prÃ³xima crisis sanitaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nMIRA: Vacunagate: la Â«crisis moralÂ» que podrÃ\\xada llevar a inhabilitaciÃ³n de funcionarios en PerÃº\\r\\n\\r\\nLos estados tambiÃ©n deben trabajar hacia la reducciÃ³n de sus leyes de alcance profesional para los trabajadores de la salud (â\\x80\\x9cscope of practiceÂ»). Estas leyes impiden que las enfermeras y otros profesionales mÃ©dicos ofrezcan atenciÃ³n que, debido a su educaciÃ³n y capacitaciÃ³n avanzadas, estÃ¡n mÃ¡s que calificados para brindar.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe igual manera, muchos estados suspendieron rÃ¡pidamente estas leyes al comienzo de esta pandemia. Ahora deberÃ\\xadan hacerlo de forma permanente. Reformar estas leyes mejorarÃ\\xada drÃ¡sticamente el acceso a la atenciÃ³n medica de muchos estadounidenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl Gobierno de EE.UU. tambiÃ©n tiene un papel en la creaciÃ³n de esta opciÃ³n personal. El Congreso puede trabajar para eliminar las numerosas barreras que impiden que los estadounidenses adquieran servicios mÃ©dicos a travÃ©s de cuentas de ahorro para la salud. La Ley de Cuentas de Ahorros para Gastos MÃ©dicos, por ejemplo, pudo haber eliminado el requisito de tener una pÃ³liza de seguro con deducible alto para ser propietario de una cuenta de ahorro para gastos mÃ©dicos (HSA, por sus siglas en inglÃ©s).\\r\\n\\r\\nEl proyecto de ley tambiÃ©n aumentaba el lÃ\\xadmite de contribuciÃ³n para los titulares de cuentas y les permitÃ\\xada comprar tipos adicionales de atenciÃ³n para ellos y sus familias. Los beneficios de estas reformas no son solo teorÃ\\xada. Ya hemos visto cÃ³mo un pequeÃ±o cambio en la regla federal, que permite a los propietarios de HSA comprar suscripciones directas de atenciÃ³n primaria con sus cuentas, ha ofrecido a mÃ¡s estadounidenses acceso las 24 horas del dÃ\\xada a los principales proveedores mÃ©dicos del paÃ\\xads.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa pandemia ha puesto al descubierto muchas de las fallas de nuestro sistema de atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica. Entre ellos, los mandatos burocrÃ¡ticos.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl Congreso de EE.UU. y los estados actuaron rÃ¡pidamente al comienzo de esta crisis de salud para suspender mucha de esta burocracia que impedÃ\\xada que los estadounidenses tuvieran opciones individuales de seguro mÃ©dico. Muchos de nuestros legisladores merecen elogios por eso.\\r\\n\\r\\nPero los obstÃ¡culos al acceso de la atenciÃ³n medica volverÃ¡n cuando termine la pandemia. Es por eso que los legisladores deben buscar reformas permanentes en nuestro sistema de salud, en lugar de implementar una soluciÃ³n federal disfuncional con un enfoque uniforme para todos los estados.\\r\\n\\r\\nNuestros legisladores pueden hacer mÃ¡s, sin procesos burocrÃ¡ticos, para mejorar la atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica de los estadounidenses.

Y no solamente las llevan las seÃ±oras elegantes -que siempre las han adorado- y polÃ\\xadticas exitosas como la vicepresidenta de Estados Unidos Kamala Harris, igual que lo hacÃ\\xada Margaret Thatcher, la famosa â\\x80\\x9cDama de Hierroâ\\x80\\x9d del Reino Unido, sino mujeres jÃ³venes y muy â\\x80\\x9ccoolâ\\x80\\x9d, que encuentran en ellas el acompaÃ±ante perfecto y el â\\x80\\x9clookâ\\x80\\x9d del momento. AdemÃ¡s es conocido que Â¡los reflejos y la imagen de las perlas embellecen y rejuvenecen con gran elegancia!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nY (Â¡esto me encanta!) las perlas -por siglos y siglos- han sido fuente de todo tipo de historias romÃ¡nticas, igual que de momentos trÃ¡gicos, grandes leyendas y fascinantes misterios. Con su rara belleza, desde la Ã©poca de los romanos â\\x80\\x93Â¡quienes creÃ\\xadan que las perlas eran las lÃ¡grimas de los dioses!- y de los griegos â\\x80\\x93quienes pensaban que se formaban en el mar cuando los dioses descargaban su energÃ\\xada y caÃ\\xadan rayos y centellasâ\\x80\\x93 las perlas han seducido a mujeres tan diversas como la reina MarÃ\\xada del Reino Unido, la emperatriz Eugenia de Montijo de Francia, la reina Isabel II de Inglaterra, la creadora Coco Chanel, quien adoraba las perlas mÃ¡s que nadie, la icÃ³nica Jackie Kennedy Onassis, la actriz Audrey Hepburn (recuerden el look en su pelÃ\\xadcula â\\x80\\x9cDesayuno en Tiffanyâ\\x80\\x9d Â¡yÂ¿ a quÃ© mujer no le encantarÃ\\xada lucir como ella?!), las diseÃ±adoras Carolina Herrera y Paloma Picasso, la princesa Grace de MÃ³naco y su hija, la tambiÃ©n princesa Carolina de MÃ³naco yâ\\x80¦ Â¡otra princesa! Diana de Gales, entre muchas otras.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaciendo investigaciÃ³n hace unos aÃ±os en los archivos de Tiffany & Co comprobÃ© que el presidente Abraham Lincoln comprÃ³ allÃ\\xad un collar de perlas para su esposa. Elizabeth Taylor era otra amante de las perlas y tenÃ\\xada infinidad de joyas y collares con perlas, incluyendo La Peregrina con mÃ¡s de 500 aÃ±os de trÃ¡gica historia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEs fascinante recordar que algo tan sencillo â\\x80\\x94 que comenzÃ³ a formarse dentro de moluscos en el fondo del mar hace siglosâ\\x80\\x93 se haya convertido en una de las joyas mÃ¡s bellas que existen. Â¡Y una fuente de fantasÃ\\xada para todos!\\r\\n\\r\\nOPINIÃ\\x93N | A pesar de todo Â¡seguimos â\\x80\\x9cqueriÃ©ndonosâ\\x80\\x9d y cuidÃ¡ndonos! Y eso es buenoâ\\x80¦\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nRevisando esas perlas de la abuela\\r\\n\\r\\nMuchas hemos heredado perlas de nuestras madres y nuestras abuelas -y probablemente ahora tengan un lustre mucho mÃ¡s bonito, mÃ¡s â\\x80\\x98perladoâ\\x80\\x99, que hace aÃ±os. Y es posible que se les note mÃ¡s el famoso â\\x80\\x98orienteâ\\x80\\x99 que reflejan cuando estÃ¡n en contacto con nuestra piel. SegÃºn las creencias populares, cada mujer â\\x80\\x98da calorâ\\x80\\x99 a sus perlas y estas â\\x80\\x98respondenâ\\x80\\x99 con cambios de tonos y un brillo muy especial.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¡Yo lo creo porque en mi madre las perlas de mi abuela se veÃ\\xadan regias y en sus hermanas no! Los gemÃ³logos expertos en perlas naturales o de cultivo â\\x80\\x93las que debemos recordar son de origen orgÃ¡nico- explican que el â\\x80\\x98orienteâ\\x80\\x99 de las perlas es el efecto producido por la luz en las distintas capas nacaradas que forman la perla y mientras mÃ¡s capas nacaradas tiene una perla Â¡mÃ¡s bello su lustre y su oriente!\\r\\n\\r\\nEl mundo de las perlas es fascinante pues se trata de la Ãºnica joya de origen orgÃ¡nico que no necesita de la mano del hombre para lucir bella. Desde el momento en que se sacan de la ostra, las perlas naturales se ven tan bellas como cuando forman parte de un collar. Y en una ocasiÃ³n vi algunas reciÃ©n sacadas del mar en JapÃ³n -y al instante comprobÃ© su belleza.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¿Y quÃ© hace a una perla valiosa?\\r\\n\\r\\nSegÃºn expertos de Tiffany & Co. no podemos apreciar el valor de una perla a simple vista, porque no podemos ver el grosor del nÃ¡car (lo mÃ¡s importante para determinar la calidad) y se requiere usar una mÃ¡quina de rayos X para saber cuÃ¡ntas capas de nÃ¡car tiene una perla â\\x80\\x93Â¡muy curioso!â\\x80\\x93 y la cantidad de aÃ±os que pasÃ³ la ostra bajo el agua, y mientras mÃ¡s capas tenga, significa que el molusco pasÃ³ mÃ¡s tiempo en el mar. Una perla de menos valor posiblemente pasÃ³ tan solo un aÃ±o en el agua -y su escasez de nÃ¡car provocarÃ¡ que se rompa con mÃ¡s facilidad. Por ejemplo, las perlas de de agua fresca pasan hasta 5 aÃ±os bajo el agua.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuy pocas personas saben estos detalles Â¡y son interesantÃ\\xadsimos! Igual que la forma de la perla determina mucho su valor. Hace aÃ±os entrevistÃ© en Nueva York al magnate llamado â\\x80\\x9cRey de las Perlasâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93el famoso joyero Salvador Assael â\\x80\\x93(que me presentÃ³ nuestro amigo Oscar de la Renta, para quien habÃ\\xada creado unos botones de perlas para unos â\\x80\\x98suitsâ\\x80\\x99 preciosos que causaron sensaciÃ³n) â\\x80\\x93y me explicÃ³ que la perla redonda es mÃ¡s valiosa, pero pueden existir variantes muy bonitas.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl brillo es tambiÃ©n muy importante. Mientras mÃ¡s brillo tiene una perla, mÃ¡s valiosa es. Y este se logra gracias a las capas de nÃ¡car y a una superficie lisa y sin impurezas. Hay perlas de muchos colores, como la perla Akoya, de una tonalidad rosa, preciosa, que gustan mucho. Existen otras con tonos dorados y plateados, propios de las perlas que vienen de los ocÃ©anos Ã\\x8dndico y PacÃ\\xadfico â\\x80\\x93mientras que muchas de las famosas perlas de TahitÃ\\xad tienen tonos grises y negros. Â¡Y mientras mÃ¡s grande sea la perla, pues mÃ¡s fina y mÃ¡s rara! Las perlas que vienen de los mares del sur son las de mayor tamaÃ±o y las mÃ¡s deslumbrantes de todas. Pueden alcanzar hasta 24 centÃ\\xadmetros de diÃ¡metro y son tan valiosas que vienen montadas en platino y diamantes para realzar su valor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ¿Su origen?\\r\\n\\r\\nCuriosamente, la mayorÃ\\xada de las perlas que se venden hoy en dÃ\\xada son cultivadas, porque las naturales estÃ¡n casi extintas y hay muy pocas en el mundo. En el pasado a la ostra le entraba un parÃ¡sito- Â¡algo que era causado por la naturaleza sin intervenciÃ³n humana!- y cuando se sentÃ\\xada â\\x80\\x98irritadaâ\\x80\\x99 segregaba nÃ¡car para envolverlo, convirtiÃ©ndolo en un cuerpo que no le molestaba -Â¡y de este proceso tan increÃ\\xadble surgÃ\\xadan las perlas naturales! Las perlas cultivadas nacieron cuando hace mÃ¡s de cien aÃ±os un japonÃ©s llamado Mikimoto se dio cuenta de que al meter una pequeÃ±a cuenta en el lugar apropiado de la ostra, esta se siente igual de irritada Â¡segrega nÃ¡car y forma una perla!',\n",

Ver mÃ¡s opiniones en cnne.com/opinion\\r\\n\\r\\n(CNN EspaÃ±ol) â\\x80\\x94 Los demÃ³cratas no tenÃ\\xadan otra opciÃ³n que hacerle un juicio polÃ\\xadtico a Donald Trump por incitar los hechos de violencia de sus partidarios durante la toma del Capitolio de Estados Unidos el 6 de enero. Los demÃ³cratas tampoco tuvieron otra opciÃ³n la vez anterior, cuando se hizo pÃºblica la llamada de presiÃ³n de Trump a Volodymyr Zelensky para que iniciara una investigaciÃ³n falsa contra el hijo de Biden a cambio de que Ucrania pudiera recibir un jugoso paquete de ayuda militar.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl primer juicio polÃ\\xadtico fue sobre corrupciÃ³n, el segundo sobre violencia. En ninguno de los casos existÃ\\xadan los votos para condenarle, pues se necesitan 2/3 del Senado. En el primer juicio polÃ\\xadtico tenÃ\\xadan apenas 49 y consiguieron 51. Para el segundo tenÃ\\xadan 50 y consiguieron 57 con 7 votos de republicanos (necesitaban 67 para condenarlo en ambos procesos). Esta vez consiguieron mayor respaldo de los senadores conservadores, pero tampoco fue suficiente.\\r\\n\\r\\nSin los votos darÃ\\xada la impresiÃ³n de que todo se quedÃ³ en un ejercicio inÃºtil de Ã©tica polÃ\\xadtica. Al ser un juicio polÃ\\xadtico, quizÃ¡s fue solo eso: â\\x80\\x9cun juicio polÃ\\xadticoâ\\x80\\x9d, pero sin la condena por no tener los votos. Sin embargo, como dijo el propio lÃ\\xadder de la minorÃ\\xada republicana en el Senado, Mitch McConnell: las posibles consecuencias civiles y penales (o sea un verdadero juicio en el sistema judicial), son hoy mucho mÃ¡s reales de lo que eran antes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesde mucho antes de estos dos juicios polÃ\\xadticos, Donald Trump ya enfrentaba algunos procesos penales y civiles muy graves por una variedad de casos, sobre todo en cortes de Nueva York, New Jersey y Washington. Esos casos estaban detenidos â\\x80\\x94en gran parteâ\\x80\\x94 por la protecciÃ³n que gozaba como presidente, que ya se agotÃ³. Efectivamente, Trump tiene pendiente una cadena de probables juicios sobre muchos temas: tratos comerciales, intento de anular una elecciÃ³n (Georgia) y la insurrecciÃ³n en el Capitolio, entre otros.\\r\\n\\r\\nSerÃ\\xada ideal separar las respuestas polÃ\\xadticas de las judiciales, pero lastimosamente el exmandatario lo hace muy difÃ\\xadcil. PolÃ\\xadticamente, estoy convencido de que Donald Trump es un problema para el Partido Republicano. Bajo su liderazgo, los conservadores perdieron en los Ãºltimos dos aÃ±os la CÃ¡mara de Representantes, el Senado, la Presidencia de EE.UU. y algunos estados del sur que estuvieron cÃ³modamente en manos republicanas por mÃ¡s de 20 aÃ±os. Los precandidatos del partido necesitan a Trump para ganar cualquier elecciÃ³n interna y ser candidatos, pero, como muestran las elecciones generales de los Ãºltimos dos aÃ±os, las posibilidades de los candidatos respaldados por Trump de ganar elecciones generales no son viables. Y ahora, todos los polÃ\\xadticos estÃ¡n pensando en su prÃ³xima elecciÃ³n.\\r\\n\\r\\npublicidad\\r\\n\\r\\nSin duda, por eso Mitch McConnell condenÃ³, quizÃ¡s con mÃ¡s Ã\\xadmpetu que los fiscales del juicio polÃ\\xadtico, el papel que Trump desempeÃ±Ã³ en la incitaciÃ³n de los hechos de violencia durante el asalto al Capitolio. El expresidente no lo tomÃ³ muy bien y lo acusÃ³ de ser â\\x80\\x9cun mercenario polÃ\\xadtico terco, hosco y aburridoâ\\x80\\x9d, y pronosticÃ³ que si los senadores republicanos se quedan con Ã©l no volverÃ¡n a ganar. La defensa del expresidente en este Ãºltimo juicio polÃ\\xadtico fue una vergÃ¼enza. Sus abogados quisieron dar un discurso polÃ\\xadtico (sin haber demostrado dicha habilidad en elecciÃ³n alguna) y fue mÃ¡s bien, fue Mitch McConnell quien defendiÃ³ mejor a Trump. Lo acusÃ³, pero se centrÃ³ en que el juicio era inconstitucional (cosa muy debatible) e inoficioso porque, estando fuera del poder, no se lo podÃ\\xada destituir.\\r\\n\\r\\nSostuve durante la cobertura especial de CNN sobre este juicio polÃ\\xadtico a Donald Trump, y lo sigo sosteniendo, que el hecho de que McConnell haya realizado una condena expresa es saludable para educar a la opiniÃ³n pÃºblica y dejarle claro que esos sucesos no deben ser aceptables. Le faltÃ³ votar en concordancia, pero lastimosamente asÃ\\xad son la mayorÃ\\xada de los polÃ\\xadticos. Tratan de quedar bien â\\x80\\x9ccon Dios y con el Diabloâ\\x80\\x9d olvidÃ¡ndose de que Donald Trump no solo pedÃ\\xada su voto sino tambiÃ©n su lealtad, como lo expresÃ³ su exabogado personal Michael Cohen, ya condenado a prisiÃ³n.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuchos quisiÃ©ramos dejar las malas historias atrÃ¡s y en el olvido. Como gran parte de las vÃ\\xadctimas de cualquier crimen que no quisieran ir todos los dÃ\\xadas a la corte para revivir los detalles del hecho, debemos hacerlo para que no quede impune y evitar nuevas vÃ\\xadctimas. Revivir la escena de un crimen no es un hecho terapÃ©utico para las vÃ\\xadctimas: es tortuoso. Pero es lo que debemos hacer. Donald Trump seguirÃ¡ en la arena pÃºblica: es su mejor defensa y tambiÃ©n ataque para sobrellevar los mÃºltiples juicios que podrÃ\\xada enfrentar. AdemÃ¡s, es lo mejor que sabe hacer. SerÃ¡ poco saludable para la sociedad seguir escuchÃ¡ndolo decir mentiras o apoyando polÃ\\xadticamente a gente impresentable como Marjorie Taylor Greene, haciendo campaÃ±a por ellas/ellos (incluyendo Ted Cruz), y recaudando dinero para ellos; pero lastimosamente, me temo que es lo que vamos a presenciar hasta que al final se haga justicia. Y a diferencia de hoy, lo mÃ¡s probable es que la justicia polÃ\\xadtica llegue mÃ¡s rÃ¡pida que la penal: serÃ¡ en la elecciÃ³n de mitad de perÃ\\xadodo del 2022 cuando reciba una derrota decisiva.',\n",

And its 41 theaters, including iconic century-old ones like the Belasco, Lyceum and New Amsterdam, will likely remain closed for many months, despite ongoing discussions about potential safety measures, like a cap on audience sizes or requiring attendees to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation is dire for many of the 97,000 people who rely on Broadway for their livelihoods -- and for New York City, which benefits from the almost $15 billion generated by the industry each year, according to The Broadway League, a trade association representing producers and theater owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nView of the closed Richard Rogers Theater near Times Square on October 12, 2020 in New York City.

It\\'s not just a job for us. This is our lives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGabrielle McClinton, who was last seen on Broadway in the role of Annie in \"Chicago the Musical,\" echoes the heartbreak and hardship endured by many in New York\\'s tightknit theater community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So many people have lost their jobs, and not just the actors, dancers, and singers (but also) the musicians, ushers and crew people. I know all my friends have been struggling, but they\\'ve been making it work by creating their own projects and kind of pivoting in different directions -- moving more into the TV and film realms,\" McClinton says.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed\\'s and McClinton\\'s dedication to their craft has taken them to the other side of the world -- literally. Nearly ten thousand miles from Broadway, in Sydney, Australia, live theater is thriving. The city is one of the few places in the world where performances are open to the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nPedestrians walk past the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia on January 14, 2021.

He and his husband Balmeet, a doctor in Los Angeles, have been apart for almost a year. But if Kelly leaves Australia, he won\\'t be allowed to return, given that the country has banned entry to all non-residents since March of last year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m away from my family.

People came to the show wearing their masks and we would get Covid-19 tested every week. When we (weren\\'t) on stage, we were in our masks and everybody obeyed all the rules and we did our due diligence. And when we were outside the theater we made sure we weren\\'t putting other people at risk,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(In Australia) people are making it work. I know it can work, because we did it.

Wright serves as Artistic Associate for the renowned Belvoir St Theatre, which in September became one of the first theaters in Australia to reopen after authorities shuttered venues around the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nParts of Australia endured some of the world\\'s harshest Covid-19 lockdowns at the height of the pandemic last year. But the tough measures -- including the imposition of curfews and strict curbs on social gatherings -- appear to have paid off, with local cases virtually eliminated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The reason why Sydney has been able to reopen is because people at local, state and federal levels took seriously the safety of the most vulnerable people in society. And we\\'re a reflection of that,\" Wright says, adding: \"You need political and social leadership to provide a safe set of circumstances for theater to reopen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belvoir St Theatre captured at night.

Look, I\\'m an American. I\\'m over here (in Australia) and they\\'re nailing it. So, try and get on board, even if it\\'s not the most comfortable thing.

Emerging from a hotel elevator, she performed a dramatic high kick before gliding down the lobby on her way to winning Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy, for her performance in \"I Care a Lot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, there were plenty of bright colors and lots of escapist fun on display -- from feathers to elaborate embroidery -- as stars posted their glamorous snaps to Instagram and Twitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaley Cuoco, nominated for her role in \"The Flight Attendant,\" opted for a sparkling silver princess dress by Oscar de la Renta. Amanda Seyfried also chose Oscar de la Renta, channeling old Hollywood glamour in a stunning a coral gown with floral embellishments.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the evening\\'s big winners also wowed with their stay-at-home fashion -- not least of all Andra Day, who posted images of her herself in a silk dress from Chanel\\'s Spring/Summer Haute Couture 2021. She later won Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama, for her performance in \"The United States vs Billie Holiday.\" Emma Corin, who took home a Golden Globe for her role as Princess Diana in \"The Crown,\" meanwhile looked fittingly regal in a custom Miu Miu gown with an Elizabethan-inspired ruff collar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose fortunate enough to walk the red carpet in person also brought pops of color and playful detailing. Angela Bassett wore a one-shouldered Dolce and Gabbana gown with feather trims, and Awkwafina went for retro wavy stripes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut none could match Cynthia Erivo for boldness. One of the best-dressed stars of last year\\'s awards season, she stunned in a futuristic neon green Valentino number with daring silver platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was plenty of eye-catching menswear on display, too. \"Schitt\\'s Creek\" co-creator and co-star Dan Levy took a literal approach to Golden Globes fashion by pairing his chartreuse Valentino suit with metallic shoes and a gold sequined top. Leslie Odom Jr. also looked dapper in a dark pinkish-brown suit with mint green turtleneck, while Bill Murray shunned protocol altogether by wearing a fluorescent Hawaiian shirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nDan Levy posted images of his outfit to Instagram ahead of the ceremony, where his show \"Schitt\\'s Creek\" was named best TV series (musical or comedy).

A notable difference is the much more diverse group of women to Cukor\\'s all-White ensemble, and Scott has also included models of different sizes and ages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s not just one archetype of age or beauty,\" American-born Scott said of his film\\'s cast. \"There\\'s many different races; there\\'s different body types.

Due to the limitations of Fashion Week during the global health crisis, the film is the second unconventional showing for the Italian label since last year. For its Spring-Summer 2021 collection, Scott sent marionettes wearing tiny Moschino looks down a runway set, with doppelgangers of famous fashion faces in the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been very fortunate to be able to find another way of expressing myself outside of the traditional fashion show with having everyone gather together, which is not possible this time,\" said Scott.\\r\\n\\r\\nA behind-the-scenes shot from the Moschino film.

During the urban safari, replete with faux-plant jungle, models prowl around in animal-inspired outfits, including a long-tailed gold alligator two-piece skirt suit, and a black one-shoulder mini-dress with a glitzy embellished flamingo. Finally, at the theater the models swan about in red-carpet gowns and capes with chunky jewelry and stacks of pearls, as well as one dramatic shawl in the shape of oversized black evening gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many industries, the pandemic has upended the norms of the fashion world, and Scott hopes that Moschino\\'s irreverent shows provide some much-needed joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The most important thing I always want to communicate with my collections and my work and my shows is really bringing some humor and ... a little joy and levity,\" he said. \"I think that that\\'s the most important thing I can do in my work.\"',\n",

       " 'Written by Scarlett Conlon, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are times in every successful designer\\'s career when they find something they created at the center of a viral sensation. For Max Mara\\'s creative director, Ian Griffiths, discovering that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had ignited a global frenzy by wearing his red \"Fire Coat\" for her infamous showdown with Donald Trump in 2018 was one of those moments. It was not, however, quite as he had imagined it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was 7 in the evening and I got the phone call from our American communications office. I had just got home from work and was in the middle of getting changed with my trousers around my knees,\" laughed Griffiths on the phone from his office in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy. \"They needed urgent confirmation the coat was ours, then more and more calls came in to give quotes. I spent the whole evening shuffling around my apartment with my trousers around my ankles because I didn\\'t have time to take them off!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That gives you an idea of how out of the blue it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment may have caught the down-to-earth Griffiths off guard, but Max Mara was hardly a leftfield choice for Pelosi, who had worn the same coat to President Obama\\'s second inauguration in 2013. The Italian brand, which is famed for its camel coats and marks its 70th anniversary this year, has always been about \"making real clothes for real women,\" said British-born Griffiths, who joined the label straight out of school in 1987 and has remained there ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nNancy Pelosi wearing Max Mara. Credit: Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe designer recalled an early meeting with the brand\\'s late founder, Achille Maramotti: \"He told (me) his intention was always to dress the wife of the local doctor or lawyer; he wasn\\'t at all interested in dressing princesses or countesses in Rome. He chose so wisely because over the last 70 years those women (have risen up) and Max Mara went with them. Now rather than the wife of the doctor, they are the doctor, if not the director of (an) entire healthcare trust. \"\\r\\n\\r\\nBritannic style with an Italian accent, Max Mara\\'s AW21 collection is for the \"self-made queens,\" writes the show notes.

The US Vice President generated headlines for the brand last November when she was photographed wearing one of its grey military-inspired \"Deborah\" coats on the campaign trail in Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She looked like a figure from the American War of Independence, with the flags in the background and raising her arm in the air ... it was such a powerful image,\" said Griffiths. With both Harris and Pelosi, he continued, \"it appeared they were not simply wearing (the coats) as a utility, but in a way that really made a statement (and) as a vehicle to say something I absolutely agree with.\" It was, he admitted, incredibly rewarding.\\r\\n\\r\\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks during a drive-in get out to vote rally in Philadelphia, 2020. Credit: Michael Perez/AP\\r\\n\\r\\nCelebrating a legacy\\r\\n\\r\\nGriffiths is acknowledging the brand\\'s landmark anniversary this year by paying tribute to strong, independent women like Harris and Pelosi. In keeping with Maramotti\\'s original vision, he may not be concerned with royalty per se, but he is intent on making clothes to empower women to rule the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems only fitting that Griffiths is helping Max Mara mark its 70th birthday with a special anniversary collection . Unveiled digitally at Milan Fashion week Thursday, the Fall-Winter 2021 line is as empowering as one has come to expect from the Italian label.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Celebrating this tremendous event, I was thinking about the Max Mara woman as a triumphant self-made queen in a moment of jubilation at her ascent,\" he enthused.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe digital presentation kicked off with behind-the-scenes images of a model being enrobed in a Max Mara coat before taking to the circular runway inside the Triennale di Milano. The imposing curved space, which reminded Griffiths of London\\'s Regent Street, was decked out in flags featuring symbols from the brand\\'s archive to give the flavor of a coronation or parade. Among the symbols was a retro exclamation point that the designer discovered on 1950s Max Mara advertising from the brand\\'s archive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symbol \"captures the entire spirit of the collection,\" he said. \"How (else) do you describe the sense of exhilaration and epic adventure of this 70-year ascent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its beginnings in 1951, Max Mara was obsessed with a love of all things \"authentically -- bordering on eccentrically -- British,\" Griffiths added. For this collection he looked to tractor-driving, helicopter-piloting, pioneering women by way of kilts (\"traditional but also rooted in punk culture\"); quilted coats made from pure camel hair; utilitarian jackets executed in sumptuous alpaca; organza shirts \"which are dramatically jaunty\"; and chunky socks and walking boots.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the show notes, the collection is an \"urban country-mix\" with cocooning aran knits and slouchy tartan skirts. Credit: Max Mara\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a collection of \"unconservative classics,\" he explained, which is also an apt description of the designer himself. Part free spirit, part quintessential gentleman, Griffiths is a former club kid turned creative commander of one of the world\\'s oldest, most sophisticated luxury houses -- and he has a charming penchant for pocket squares. Given that he spent most of the UK\\'s Covid-19 lockdown at his home in the Suffolk countryside, his collection\\'s bucolic inspirations appear all the more personal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s inevitable that a lot of my story goes into there,\" he said, pointing to the recent pictures on his Instagram account. \"Those images of my experiences being in the countryside over the summer, having long walks with my dogs, the way I used to dress 30 years ago, punk culture, the idea of an independent rebellious spirit, refusing to accept convention -- they are all ideas that are central to my thinking. Primarily, (however), I channel it so that it appeals to the Max Mara woman, as it\\'s all about her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new collection shown at Milan Fashion Week reimagines Max Mara\\'s trademark camel coat. Credit: Max Mara\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic\\'s impact on Max Mara\\'s customers was also an important consideration, Griffiths said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s made me think very hard about who (she is) and appreciate even more greatly the struggles she has been through, which have been thrown into even sharper relief by what\\'s happened over the last year,\" he said. \"I want to show her emerging from this hardship triumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s our 70-year celebration but it\\'s also a collection that\\'s timed for a moment next winter, 2021, when all over the world, restrictions will start to be lifted and people can enjoy the world they live in and celebrate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upcoming collection is, he affirmed, a \"double celebration, in a sense\". In Griffiths\\' enthusiasm for design, sartorial expression and hope, Max Mara has much to celebrate, too.',\n",
       " 'Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nOver a century ago, Suzanne Valadon began painting lively nude portraits of sensual and self-assured women, with full, curvy bodies and pubic hair. Occasionally, she painted nude men as well, bucking art historical tradition and presenting them as figures of desire. Her canvases were full of bold outlines, vibrant colors and loose brushwork, and she deftly illustrated her subjects\\' interior lives, rather than the idealized scenes of leisure so prevalent at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nChampioned by some of her most famous contemporaries, including Edgar Degas and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Valadon was no minor artist, and one of the few women painters of the era to receive critical acclaim. Yet, like many women artists of the 20th century, her fame faded after her death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuzanne Valadon was a famous artists\\' model who posed for Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec before striking out on her own to paint. Credit: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nBut today, curators and art historians are taking a second look at Valadon\\'s works, and reconsidering her life with more nuance. This September, the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia will stage her first major institutional show in the US, positioning her as an important yet underrecognized modern artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the start, Valadon was a controversial figure in Paris\\' thriving art scene at the turn of the century, known as much for her bohemian attitudes and provocative personal life as her distinct, rebellious vision.\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon\\'s paintings featured contemporary women with body hair, curves and a strong sense of self, diverging from the delicate femininity and timelessness favored in art. Pictured: \"Nude on the Sofa,\" 1920. Credit: Suzanne Valadon\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People were quite scandalized by her lifestyle,\" said Nancy Ireson, deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the Barnes Foundation. \"The fact that she had a younger lover; the fact that her son (the artist Maurice Utrillo), who was a famous painter, was also an alcoholic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is over 100 years ago, but I\\'m sure that women still face the same kinds of criticisms these days. How do you balance a successful career with being a good wife and a good mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'She understood how to perform\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1865, Suzanne Valadon was born Marie-ClÃ©mentine Valadon to an impoverished single mother in Montmartre. In her 2017 biography, \"Renoir\\'s Dancer,\" Catherine Hewitt describes the young artist as a headstrong, imaginative child who exasperated the nuns trying to teach her. Valadon held a series of short-lived menial jobs before training as a circus performer at 15 years old, but her career was cut short by a back injury sustained during a trapeze stunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon will receive her first major US show at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia this fall, a century after she began receiving critical acclaim for her work. Pictured: \"Nude Sitting on a Sofa,\" 1916. Credit: The Weisman & Michel Collection\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during her recovery that Valadon began to draw. Lacking the training or money typically needed to enter the art world, she began modeling for artists. It was a salacious job, considered to be on par with sex work at the time, but one that offered her direct access to the art milieu of Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon slipped into the new role with ease, serving as painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes\\' model for more than seven years. In works by lesser-known artists, she transformed into figures of allegory and myth: the sultry Greek siren in a Gustav Wertheimer canvas, the feminine embodiment of truth for Czech painter VojtÄ\\x95ch Hynais, always with her auburn hair as her calling card.\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon was a female artist from a low-income background with no formal training, making her entry into the art world unheard of at the time. Pictured: \"Joy of Life,\" 1911. Credit: Sepia Times/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nHer reputation spread through word of mouth, as well as her determination to socialize and network in spaces exclusive to male artists, particularly the smoky, absinthe-steeped rooms of Parisian cafe culture. Soon Valadon was populating the works of some of the most famous Impressionist painters of the time. Most famously, she danced across Renoir\\'s scenes of societal leisure, in \"Dance in the City\" and, likely, \"Dance at Bougival,\" both from 1883.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t just that she was good-looking,\" said Ireson. \"She understood how to perform, how to create a character. And so in different works, by different artists, she becomes almost a different person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA stop-start career\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon did more than just pose. She used the sessions as informal training, observing and learning from the artists for whom she modeled. When she showed painter Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, he introduced her to Degas, who became her mentor in 1889.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she was beginning to stake her claim in the art world, Valadon was raising a young child.

Pictured: \"Reclining Nude,\" 1928. Credit: Sepia Times/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Valadon first began receiving attention for her work in her late 20s, Degas suggested she show at the Salon de la SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1894. \"For an untrained, lower-class woman artist to have her work accepted -- it was outlandish, unthinkable, impossible,\" Hewitt wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon had five drawings of children accepted. In each, her subjects were depicted as moody and natural, unlike other domestic scenes of the time. But in the catalog, she was listed as the androgynous \"Valadon, S.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough her early exhibitions, Valadon caught the interest of major art dealers. But when she married businessman Paul Mousis and moved out of Paris, her artistic output slowed. Further complicating her life were her son Maurice\\'s troubles in school, and his growing alcohol addiction, which first took hold when he was a teenager. She often put her energy into Maurice\\'s artistic talent, hoping that a painting practice would ease his troubles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Valadon\\'s first showing at the prestigious Salon de la SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1894, for a series of drawings, her listed name, \"Valadon, S.,\" did not reveal her gender. Pictured: \"Woman in White Stockings,\" 1924. Credit: Suzanne Valadon\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Degas continued to submit Valadon\\'s work to exhibitions, she wouldn\\'t give her full attention to her art career again until she was 45 years old, after she left her husband for the younger artist AndrÃ© Utter. She began to paint prolifically, making studies of herself and her family, as well as the nudes she became known for. In 1909, her painting \"Summer\" was accepted into the new and trendy Salon d\\'Automne, followed by her first solo show in 1911.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1920s, Valadon began receiving critical acclaim. She was mentioned on the front page of French newspaper Le Gaulois, and critics took notice of her 1921 show at John Levy Gallery in Paris. French critic AndrÃ© Warnod described her nudes as \"powerful,\" according to Hewitt, and observed that they \"enchant the viewer by virtue of the truth that emanates from them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon\\'s figures didn\\'t adhere to the delicate femininity that was expected of the time. They were contemporary women with modern clothes and hairstyles, as well as body hair -- a far cry from the timeless nudes so prevalent in art history, Ireson points out.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven more surprising were Valadon\\'s depictions of nude men, though she rarely painted them. \"The fact she was painting male nudes at all in the early 20th century was pretty shocking,\" Ireson said. \"And she paints the male nude in quite a sexualized way. You can see that there\\'s a desire there; there\\'s an appreciation of the body that was quite audacious for the time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon\\'s sensual depictions of the male body were daring, like in 1914\\'s \"Casting the Net.\" Credit: Suzanne Valadon\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1923, in her late 50s, Valadon painted her most notable work, \"The Blue Room,\" depicting a curvy brunette reclining among the patterned blue sheets and curtains of a daybed, a stack of books at her feet. Caught mid-thought, a cigarette dangling from her mouth, she pays little attention to the viewer, emanating confidence through her casual ease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strength, Suzanne suggested, was compatible with and even complementary to the idea of \\'woman,\\'\" wrote Hewitt of the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder-recognized after death\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon also chronicled her own body as she aged, painting herself nude well into her 60s -- which, Ireson pointed out, would still \"raise a few eyebrows\" today. In her later self-portraits, she shows herself solemn, her mouth pursed, favoring hard edges and dark, neutral tones over the softer, brighter scenes of her earlier works.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of the things that\\'s quite striking when you look at her self-portraits is her attitude to aging,\" said Ireson. \"(There\\'s) a refusal of prettiness there ... And an attention (to) the artifice of beautifying yourself, and then this very unflinching representation of her body as it changes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nValadon painted self-portraits as she aged, eschewing idealized views of herself. Pictured: \"Self-Portrait,\" 1927.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last decade of her career, Valadon exhibited worldwide, with shows in New York, Prague, Chicago and Berlin. In 1938, after a lauded retrospective at Galerie Bernier in Paris, she died at the age of 72 after suffering a stroke. At the time, French art critic George Besson called her \"the most justifiably famous\" woman painter of the era, according to Hewitt, while another critic predicted that her \"place in the history of 20th-century painting is already assured.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut history can be fickle, and Valadon\\'s fame dimmed following her death, perhaps because she was never associated with a particular art movement, or because she was overshadowed by her male peers. She was also routinely excluded from French art critic Louis Vauxcelles\\' influential exhibitions and books, on the basis that he simply didn\\'t like her work, according to Hewitt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with figurative painting recently brought back to the fore, and overlooked women artists being revisited, Valadon\\'s work is primed for a revival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s like an undiscovered chapter of a book that you figured you knew,\" Ireson said. \"If you know Toulouse-Lautrec and Renoir, and the painters of the 1920s and \\'30s, Suzanne Valadon is absolutely part of that story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTop caption: \"The Blue Room,\" from 1923, is Valadon\\'s best-known work.',\n",
       " 'Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Game Boy titles \"Pocket Monsters: Red\" and \"Pocket Monsters: Green\" were first released in Japan in 1996, few could have predicted what came next.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept was simple enough: Players would traverse a fictional world capturing, training and battling the creatures that inhabited it -- a mission encapsulated in the game\\'s famous slogan, \"Gotta Catch \\'Em All.\" But within just a few years, PokÃ©mon, a portmanteau of the Japanese name \"Poketto Monsuta,\" was a global phenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1999, the game had launched in multiple Western markets, later becoming one of the most successful franchises of all time. It spawned an anime series, which was translated into over 30 languages, and trading cards that swept the world\\'s playgrounds during the \"PokÃ©mania\" of the late 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also imprinted the identities of 151 entirely fictional characters into the memories of millions.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese children participate in a PokÃ©mon card game tournament in 1999. Credit: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nA quarter of a century on, many first-generation PokÃ©mon are as recognizable to millennials as they are to their children. This is partly thanks to a post-2016 revival inspired by the mobile game \"PokÃ©mon Go\" and movie \"Detective Pikachu.\" But the franchise\\'s success is about more than clever marketing -- it is the result of unique characters that were universal enough to cross cultures and diverse enough to make catching \\'em all a challenge, not a chore.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir origins trace back to PokÃ©mon\\'s creator Tajiri Satoshi, whose childhood love of collecting bugs inspired a game with a strikingly similar premise. Most of the individual designs were, however, the work of illustrator Ken Sugimori.\\r\\n\\r\\nSugimori had worked with Tajiri on the magazine Game Freak, which would eventually grow into the games company behind PokÃ©mon. As the firm\\'s art director, he brought his collaborator\\'s vision to life through a complex and imaginative taxonomy, complete with individual lines of evolution and fictional genuses, like grass- or dragon-type PokÃ©mon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBulbasaur, one of the most recognizable PokÃ©mon from the first generation. Credit: Courtesy The Pokemon Company\\r\\n\\r\\nGiving the characters distinct personalities was always going to be difficult. Even with an accompanying TV series, most were only able to utter their own names repeatedly. Their appearances, therefore, were especially important.\\r\\n\\r\\nSugimori\\'s designs were gloriously diverse and grounded in science -- not just biology and zoology, but geology (see Geodude, who was essentially an animated rock), chemistry (the noxious gas clouds Koffing and Weezing), paleontology (the fossil-like Omanyte and Omastar) and physics (the likes of Magneton, who loosely drew on the principles of electromagnetism). The resulting catalog of creatures, known as the PokÃ©dex , was essentially a periodic table for game nerds -- and was, for many, much easier to recall.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing global\\r\\n\\r\\nPokÃ©mon\\'s ability to evolve was part of their appeal, according to Joseph Tobin, a professor of early childhood education at the University of Georgia and editor of the 2004 book \"Pikachu\\'s Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of PokÃ©mon\" (a subtitle that, he readily admits, completely failed to predict the franchise\\'s revival).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Along with Tamagotchi, the narrative was that you\\'re caring for them,\" Tobin said in a video interview. \"You care for them so they grow up, and kids can identify with getting stronger. But then you also care for them by (making sure they) don\\'t die. It was unusual to have this in a battle game ... it took some of the features of war and then combined them with nurturance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turtle-like Squirtle was one of the original Game Boy game\\'s \"starter\" characters. Credit: Courtesy The Pokemon Company\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cutesy Squirtle evoled into Wortortle and, eventually, Blastoise (pictured). Credit: Courtesy The Pokemon Company\\r\\n\\r\\nThis juxtaposition was reflected in the designs, which were at once both cute and fierce -- or, through the process of evolution, morphed from cute to fierce, from the big-eyed, babyish Squirtle to the formidable Blastoise (by way of Wartortle). None, however, more aptly embodied this dichotomy than Pikachu, the franchise\\'s most successful and marketable figure. Dumpy and rosy-cheeked, with a high-pitched voice, the electrified mouse was also a powerful fighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character\\'s design also played into Japan\\'s wider drive to export pop culture in the 1990s, according to Tobin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea was -- or the corporate strategy as a nation was -- we want \\'our\\' mouse to compete with Mickey Mouse,\" he said. \"So I think the fact that Pikachu is a mouse-like creature is not coincidental, but (the character) was made to be hyper-cute -- cuter than Mickey or Minnie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were, however, fears that Japan\\'s \"kawaii\" aesthetic wouldn\\'t resonate with kids elsewhere. Superheroes in Western markets were, at the time, often sharper and more muscular than their Japanese counterparts. Ahead of the game\\'s US release, late Nintendo boss Hiroshi Yamauchi was reportedly shown a beefed-up alternative version of Pikachu, though the company\\'s American subsidiary stuck with the original designs for its 1998 launch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all of the PokÃ©mon were the talk of the playground -- like Metapod, a crescent-shaped chrysalis. Credit: Courtesy The Pokemon Company\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while the likes of Pikachu and Bulbasaur stole the limelight -- and made it into the all-important merchandise -- there was strength in sheer diversity. And some among PokÃ©mon\\'s vast cast were neither cute nor fierce.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake Diglett, a crudely-drawn sausage-shaped mole, or Metapod, a droopy-eyed and immobile chrysalis, whose sole ability is hardening its outer shell. All were relatively useless in battle; none were the schoolyard\\'s most sought-after playing cards. But they were part of a complete universe -- one that had something for everyone. In the gender-normative world of 1990s toy marketing, that mattered, Tobin said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the toy store (at the time) you had a blue aisle and a pink aisle,\" he said. \"But PokÃ©mon was created to reach across the aisles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe art of localization\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the characters\\' designs remained the same overseas, PokÃ©mon was nonetheless adapted for different markets, especially when it came to language.\\r\\n\\r\\nCultural references would, inevitably, be lost in translation: Many characters were rooted in Japanese folklore . While audiences in Japan might have recognized the influence of fox spirit Kitsune in PokÃ©mon like Vulpix, or the mythical thunder beast Rajiu in Pikachu\\'s design, these would never translate.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman browses goods at a PokÃ©mon store in Tokyo. Credit: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the PokÃ©mon\\'s new names often remained true to the spirit of the originals. Take Sawamura and Ebiwara, who had been named after a Japanese kickboxer and boxer, respectively, but were called Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan in English, a reference to martial artists that kids in the West would recognize: Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Or Ivysaur, whose Japanese name Fushigisou combined \"fushigi\" (strange) and \"sou\" (grass), resulting in a similar principle being used for the French version: Herbizarre.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome names, like Pikachu, were transliterated more or less directly from the Japanese. But elsewhere there were portmanteaus like Psyduck (a duck with psychic powers), or names that only resonated with speakers of the language in question, like the slothful Slowpoke. There were also puns of varying quality, from the jellyfish-like Tentacool, to Exeggcute, a collection of furious eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsyduck, a duck with psychic abilities. Credit: Courtesy The Pokemon Company\\r\\n\\r\\nSome were a little less imaginative. There was a horned seal called Seel, and a crab named Krabby. The serpentine Ekans and Arbok were made simply by reversing the words \"snake\" and \"kobra\" (sic). But there were moments of linguistic sophistication, too. The game\\'s three \"Legendary Birds\" were named Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres, with the Spanish suffixes -uno, -dos and -tres reflecting their consecutive order in the PokÃ©dex. An amorphous blob, able to assume the form of anything it saw, was named, appropriately, Ditto.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anime series was also subtly adapted for overseas markets. For instance, human characters were more central to the US version\\'s narrative, because it was believed that \"Americans wanted someone to identify with that was more than just bugs and animals,\" Tobin said. But, he added, PokÃ©mon always retained something quintessentially Japanese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think the amazing thing is that it wasn\\'t changed that much. Not only was the Japanese-ness not a liability, it was associated with \\'cool Japan.\\' Kids didn\\'t like it because it was Japanese, but they certainly got the idea that it was a little bit exotic,\" he said, likening it to a type of soft power for the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Inter-generational nostalgia\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe designs kept on coming. Today, there are almost 900 characters, though many are, arguably, less memorable than their predecessors. Later generations of PokÃ©mon have included Chandelure , a sentient chandelier, Milcery , a cream-based PokÃ©mon resembling a splash of milk, and, inexplicably, a floating keyring called Klefki that is \"constantly collecting keys... (and) will protect them no matter what.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA Hasbro employee shows off components of the Pokemon Battle Stadium at the company\\'s showroom in New York in February 2000. Credit: Richard Drew/AP\\r\\n\\r\\nAffection for the first generation endures, however. The original 151 may represent just a fraction of the PokÃ©dex, but they account for over half of the PokÃ©mon featured in the 2019 movie \"Detective Pikachu.\" In December, a first-edition holographic Charizard card sold for a record $369,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nTobin, having failed to predict PokÃ©mon\\'s longevity last time around, is more optimistic about the franchise\\'s next 25 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was wrong in that I thought PokÃ©mon would, like most kids\\' media or cultural products, rise and fall and be replaced by the next big thing,\" he said. \"But I think what I, and the other authors in the book, got right was (understanding) what made PokÃ©mon so attractive at the time. And the things that made it attractive were not limited to the culture of the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformers dressed as Pikachu during a \"Pikachu Outbreak\" event hosted bin Yokohama, Japan, in 2018.

In nearby Oakland\\'s Chinatown, police said a man pushed three unsuspecting people, injuring a 91-year-old man, a 60-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman. A 64-year-old woman was robbed outside a Vietnamese market in San Jose, California.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it\\'s hard to prove such incidents are solely motivated by anti-Asian bigotry, many advocates and rights groups believe them to be, pointing to a pattern of targeted hate since the coronavirus pandemic began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lot of this (violence) has been caused by misplaced hate and anger and frustration over the pandemic, to the point where our elderly have been attacked randomly,\" Lee said in an Instagram video. \"It\\'s not just the harassment and name calling with the \"kung flu,\" it really has now moved to people being attacked and killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve been shouting it for months now and people don\\'t seem to care,\" she continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his own powerful post, Lim said watching viral videos of attacks and crimes targeting Asian businesses had been emotionally difficult. And that it wasn\\'t until he reached out to Asian American friends and colleagues that he started hearing accounts of them being \"bullied, harassed, attacked\" in their own neighborhoods, over the past month.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany in the Asian community are calling the seemingly unprovoked attacks hate crimes, spurred by racism and discrimination towards Asians during a year-long battle with the coronavirus in the US, and inflammatory language such as \"China virus,\" and \"kung flu\" vocalized by former President Donald Trump.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to data released by Stop AAPI Hate released on February 9, over 2,800 firsthand reports of anti-Asian hate across 47 states and DC -- which included physical assaults, verbal harassment, and being purposely coughed or spat on -- were collected between mid-March through the end of 2020. In January, the Biden administration signed into memorandum guidance to combat anti-Asian bias incidents, acknowledging the spike in cases that have risen during the pandemic due to \"inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric\" that \"has put Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) persons, families, communities, and businesses at risk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDesigner Prabal Gurung also took to Instagram, posting a \"how to help\" graphic that has been circulated with the #StopAsianHate campaign, with a call to action, urging his followers to volunteer or donate to community groups, to help amplify Asian artists, authors and activists, and to speak up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To build an equitable world, we have to be actively anti-racist,\" Gurung wrote in the accompanying post. \"Anti-racism is not a hashtag but a life long commitment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGurung and Lim are members of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), which this week also put out a statement on \"zero tolerance for hate crimes of any kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sit here feeling somewhat helpless, invisible, and semi-defeated because our Asian stories aren\\'t being reported in mainstream media,\" Lim said. \"It feels like we do not matter or exist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure you guys have your own family stories ... with varying details of sacrifice, but I believe all with the common goal of searching for a better life,\" he continued, after showing photos of his family\\'s journey immigrating to America to camera. \"A safe haven with the promise of infinite possibilities and the freedom to pursue the American dream in a country we all call home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I ask you as a fellow American, a fellow human being.

All opinions expressed in this article belong to the author.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018 I became the first Black ballet dancer to join Berlin\\'s principal ballet company, the Staatsballett. Joining this kind of ballet institution was my dream -- it\\'s one of the best in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut last October, I was told that my contract would not be renewed this summer. I believe it\\'s because of the complaints I have made about the racist comments and unfair treatment that I have endured from my ballet mistress, though the company has said the decision was made for \"artistic reasons.\" After trying to handle the issue internally, I went public with my story to Der Spiegel The Guardian and the New York Times\\r\\n\\r\\nI have suffered depression and humiliation -- and I am far from the only dancer who has experienced derogatory comments and verbal abuse during my career. Such behavior is institutionalized within ballet, from the time that we are children and begin our training. We don\\'t talk about it because we are taught not to.\\r\\n\\r\\nChloÃ© Lopes Gomes became the first Black dancer at Berlin\\'s prestigious Staatsballett in 2018. Credit: ChloÃ© Desnoyers\\r\\n\\r\\nWe start ballet very young, often when we are just seven or eight years old. The teachers instill in us discipline and rigor, but they also teach us not to complain -- to suffer in silence and to be \"polite.\" Many young dancers are trained to believe that, to become a ballerina, pain is part of the process. Ballet masters should treat dancers respectfully and with kindness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silence is pervasive as well because we often don\\'t have enough support or protection. The power that institutions give to the ballet masters is undeniable -- at the end of the day, they are the ones who are with us in the studio and they are the ones who give us the opportunity to improve within the company. We only have one- or two-year renewable contracts. And the ballet world is very small. Speaking out against an esteemed company can ruin a career.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy experience with racism is not isolated. I have heard over and over the damaging stereotypes that Black dancers aren\\'t flexible enough or don\\'t have the right feet, or that Asian dancers aren\\'t expressive enough. Ballet is still designed for White dancers, down to the shoes and makeup we wear. Nude-colored ballet shoes for Black dancers didn\\'t exist until 2018. I\\'ve always had to buy my own makeup, because the foundation provided has always been for White skin. I\\'ve always been the only dancer to do my own hair, because the hair stylists don\\'t know how to work with my texture. At Staatsballett, there are 95 dancers and I was the only one spending my own money on makeup. It makes you feel excluded. And it reminds me that when you are Black, you have to work harder to have the same opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve always had to buy my own makeup, because the foundation provided has always been for White skin,\" writes Gomes. Credit: Dean Barucija\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ballet world needs to change, and we have the chance to do so now, while the art form has been thrown into crisis during the coronavirus pandemic. In order for the performing arts to survive, they have to reach new audiences. In ballet, which is still primarily White and elitist, we have to make it more accessible, and we can do that by making it a more inclusive and equitable art form.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should attract talented and diverse young dancers in ballet schools and begin to remake ballet companies from the ground up to reflect the multicultural world we live in. We should put an end to the dangerous belief that dancers must always remain silent, which is drilled into us at a young age. And we should give dancers proper avenues of recourse when their teachers or directors abuse their power.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Classical arts in general have long excluded ethnic minorities because they are prohibitively expensive for underprivileged communities. It is expensive to attend the theater -- and it is even more expensive to train in the arts. It is much cheaper to go to the cinema or to play sports. I was raised in France with a very modest upbringing. My mother is a cleaning lady, and my father is a construction worker. They took out loans for what my scholarship didn\\'t cover when I attended the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Russia, following in the footsteps of two of my siblings, who are also dancers. I had to be successful; there was so much pressure on me to excel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a different vision for the future of the stage,\" Gomes writes. \"Diversity isn\\'t detrimental to the visuals of ballet.\" Credit: Dean Barucija\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe we have to democratize ballet in order to ensure its future. If ballet companies welcome more people of all backgrounds to attend its shows, more young people will fall in love with it. If ballet school directors make it their duty to seek out and nurture those aspiring dancers, and level the playing field regardless of race or income level, diverse dancers will enter the ranks. They will eventually become ballet masters, attracting and educating more dancers of color. And then the cycle continues -- more children will see themselves represented on stage; they will see a future in pointe shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBallet prizes uniformity within its dancers. We have to transform into swans or spirits, to become part of a greater whole of movement and form. But I have a different vision for the future of the stage. It\\'s so beautiful to see a blonde girl next to a Black girl, or a brown girl next to an Asian girl, all following the same choreography. Diversity isn\\'t detrimental to the visuals of ballet -- it can instead be its greatest strength.',\n",

When Stevens and Snyder met, they were both dancers on Utah\\'s powwow circuit but it took years for them to perform couples routines -- called \"sweetheart specials\" -- together. That category was exclusively performed by male and female dancers until 2018, when they became the first Two-Spirit pair to do so, after being disqualified from a dance the year prior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because our styles are so different, we had to find a way to dance together,\" Snyder is quoted as saying in Vogue . \"And for us being two men, it was surprisingly difficult.

Appalachia has often been viewed one-dimensionally, saddled in associations related to poverty and opioid use, and deemed \"Trump Country\" during the 2016 election.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Facun\\'s series on the \"Little Cities of Black Diamonds,\" named for their once-booming coal industry, shows a more nuanced and alluring take on rural Ohio, which became his home. The forthcoming book, \"Black Diamonds,\" was successfully funded on Kickstarter and will be published in spring 2021 by Fall Line Press.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Black Diamonds\" is an alluring portrait of an Appalachian town. Credit: Rich-Joseph Facun\\r\\n\\r\\nFacun is a photographer of indigenous Mexican and Filipino descent who grew up in Mississippi and Virginia and put down roots in Ohio after taking a job at Ohio University, where he studied visual communication. During his time there as a student, he lived in a \"bubble,\" he explained over video.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really didn\\'t have ... any knowledge of what rural Appalachia was like,\" he said. \"You can drive maybe five or 10 minutes in any direction and be in the country. But I wasn\\'t even aware of that. It wasn\\'t even on my radar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Facun moved to \"Trump Country\" during a period of political divide, he wanted to better understand his community and neighbors. Credit: Rich-Joseph Facun\\r\\n\\r\\nHe returned to the area 15 years later with his wife and children to homestead in the country. They settled in during the 2016 election season, and as then-candidate Donald Trump\\'s rhetoric against Mexico became more inflammatory, Facun began to grow increasingly uneasy as a person of color in a nearly all-White area. He realized he didn\\'t know his community; it was an unfamiliar feeling given his previous stints working for local newspapers\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite crossing over many state borders up and down the eastern half of the United States, the popular narrative about Appalachia is that of a deep-red, insular region. Facun was concerned about the sense of growing hostility and polarization in the country and worried it was happening in his own backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People were pointing the finger at Appalachia saying, \\'They\\'re all voting for Trump and it\\'s their fault. It\\'s middle America\\'s fault,\\' \" he said. \"I still had not met my neighbors, or any of the surrounding communities. I was just uncertain. Am I safe? Or am I living in this little bubble in the country?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEncounters with strangers\\r\\n\\r\\nFacun\\'s resulting survey of Appalachia doesn\\'t reduce the region to its politics, but instead is an exercise in making connections and understanding his home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis is a portrait of \"community and cultural identity in a polarized political climate,\" as Facun noted on the book\\'s Kickstarter page. Lush and quiet, \"Black Diamonds\" shows the beauty of Ohio\\'s foggy, wooded landscapes and a deep sense of intimacy with its residents, despite the fact that they are brief encounters.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacun\\'s series is a perspective rarely seen in the photo world -- a visual exploration of a mostly White community by a photographer of color.

Then there\\'s Kaylee, who had been crowned at the Miss Moonshine pageant during the long-running New Straitsville Moonshine Festival in Perry County.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the images were made on meandering drives, and though not every interaction was positive, Facun overwhelmingly felt a sense of hospitality and warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really found a great admiration for the people who are born and bred Appalachian,\" said Facun. \"They have this really amazing resourcefulness about them. And I think that\\'s a very admirable trait.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFacun\\'s images are a study of place, atmosphere and cultural identity.

Countless White photographers have documented communities of color for major publications, photo books, photo awards and personal projects, but a BIPOC (Black, indigenous and people of color) photographer setting out with his camera to explore a predominantly White area is much rarer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a problem on many levels when history is being documented predominantly by white males,\" Facun said. \"It\\'s a problem (that) our visual history is not being shown through the eyes of a diverse community.\"',\n",

The structure\\'s design and color was modified throughout its history. Credit: Julian Finney/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilt around 125 A.D. by the Roman emperor Publius Aelius Hadrianus, it was actually the third iteration of the structure. The first Pantheon caught fire around 80 A.D. and was rebuilt shortly after, but it was struck by lightning and burned down again around 110 A.D. The buildings\\' ill fate led to rumors that the Pantheon was cursed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe facade of the completed structure riffed on ancient Greek motifs, with a portico entrance featuring a pediment -- a triangular top -- and two rows of Corinthian columns. The interior was sweeping and airy, capped by a dome that to this day -- is still the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it used for?\\r\\n\\r\\nPantheon means \"all gods,\" and though it\\'s commonly thought the structure was a site of worship dedicated to Roman deities, its original purpose is actually unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith scant mentions of it in Ancient texts, historians have been left somewhat in the dark. Though it could be a temple, Roman buildings were typically multi-purpose structures, said Lynne Lancaster, an architectural historian and humanities educator. \"And so what actually went on in the Pantheon is hard to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pantheon may have been used for a variety of purposes, but historians aren\\'t quite sure what took place inside.

Centuries later, Neoclassical architects would reference the Pantheon\\'s portico and dome combination to imbue their buildings with those same values, from the US Capitol in Washington, DC., to the Somerset House in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow was it built?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pantheon was an architectural marvel of the Roman Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oculus -- Latin for \"eye\" -- stretches 30 feet across, opening the structure to the heavens.

Credit: Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The oculus at the center seemed to tempt fate and leave (the Pantheon) open to the sky,\" said Ochsendorf. \"But it also showed a mastery of geometry and construction -- that they could build domes on that scale and leave an oculus open at the center, in a way (that was) almost showing off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, religious leaders, who were incredulous of the feat, cast doubt on the holiness of the Pantheon, believing it to be the work of the devil.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it wasn\\'t Satan; it was engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough white, yellow, purple and black marble was imported from around the Mediterranean, it was concrete -- a Roman invention -- that allowed architects to do away with load-bearing columns and introduce spacious domes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the entry door, the oculus is the only natural source of light in the building. Credit: Alessandra Tarantino/AP\\r\\n\\r\\nOne trick to make a large dome stable was to use progressively lighter stone in the concrete mix as it reached the top. Heavy brick could be used at the base, with spongy, light volcanic rock around the oculus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the Pantheon has revealed some of its design secrets, Lancaster said she still finds magic in the details.

As Hyun surveyed a snow-covered recreation of the house where she grew up, she said she kept thinking about her parents, now long dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The faces of my mother, father, sisters and brothers flashed before me,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHyun remembered how crowded their house was with eight siblings around the dinner table, and sneaking into her dad\\'s store to eat squid without him knowing. She saw a seafood market in Pyongyang where she used to play jump rope, and Taedong River, where she used to swim as a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nHyun still lives with the pain of leaving behind two of her sisters. She briefly united with one of them in China 20 years ago, a meeting made possible by a broker with business ties in North Korea. Their meeting was filmed by a documentary crew and later televised. Her sister was just 6 years old when she left, and would live a much tougher life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If only I came with you, I could have been a star singer just like you,\" Hyun recalled her sister saying at the reunion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recreation of Hyun Mi\\'s house in Pyongyang.

I saw how she lost all her hair, all her teeth and toenails, too,\" Hyun added.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s -- around the time Hyun met with her sister -- North Korea was hit by a famine that led to an estimated 600,000 deaths, though earlier estimates put the figure much higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even today when I go to a buffet restaurant, I cry, because there is such an abundance of food,\" she said. \"It pains me greatly to see any food thrown out because it makes me think of my sisters in the North.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFuture plans for refugees\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there is no official count on the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea, South Korea\\'s Ministry of Unification said in its latest statistics released last month that, since 1988, 133,000 people have officially registered to meet their family in the north. But the chances of those reunions are dwindling as the refugees grow old. As of November, there are 49,700 refugees of those registered still alive in South Korea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhn hopes Hyun\\'s experience is only the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country\\'s unification ministry has shown interest in expanding the project next year to model other regions where refugees have previously lived, says Ahn. A ministry official said it is currently considering a plan, although they have no timeline yet. But, creating bespoke projects for every refugee will not be possible, he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhn\\'s company has interviewed a number of displaced people who, like Hyun, wish they could visit their hometown. They also wish to see their family, but the VR technology can\\'t help with that -- the experience doesn\\'t include people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHyun said while the virtual reality project gave her some comfort, what she really wants is the freedom to see her family members in real life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want a lot -- I don\\'t even want unification. I\\'d just appreciate if we can visit each other,\" she said.',\n",

       " 'Written by Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nLaunching a fashion brand is hard. Launching a fashion brand during a global pandemic is near impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Teniola \"Tia\" Adeola, her debut on the New York Fashion Week show schedule took place a little over a month before the novel coronavirus took hold of the major fashion capitals and effectively brought the global fashion industry to its knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdeola\\'s show in February was an opportunity to present her newly established eponymous brand to the world. Her designs -- youthful, sexy, sheer and ruffled -- grabbed the attention of the fashion press and secured her \"one to watch\" status.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna Wintour and Adeola at a Teen Vogue Celebrates Generation Next event in 2019 in New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days after the show, the young designer was on a proverbial high, staying up for three nights before eventually crashing out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then everything changed. Adeola went back to her family home in Lagos, Nigeria, to ride out the worst of lockdown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was bittersweet,\" said Adeola, now back in her Manhattan studio. \"I was very grateful and thankful to be quarantined with my family but going from having my studio space to sharing a room with my sister ... it was just a lot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spent the first month feeling as though she was at a total standstill and allowed herself time to be sad. But eventually Adeola got back to work. Reflecting on what got her going again, she said unwaveringly: \"I represent a generation that is going to change the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOutfits designed by Tia Adeola. Credit: Tia Adeola\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that mission in mind she dove back in, looking at paintings for hours and reconnecting with her original art history references, which inspired a series of face masks featuring her signature ruffles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdeola\\'s ruffles are a subversive response to the art history books she first studied in school. As she tells it, her high school dissertation analyzed 16th-century Spanish dress in fine art paintings. Through her research of the works from that era, she noticed there were no Black people represented in the images, unless they were depicted as slaves or jesters. While this stuck with her, she said it didn\\'t take away from the fact that the clothes in the pictures were beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The way that the artists were able to capture the texture, the fabric, the materials with their brushstrokes was just incredible to me,\" she said. \"And ruffles -- they were called \\'the ruff\\' at the time and they were made with starch ... The bigger your ruffle the higher you were in society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdeola\\'s ruffles do something to reclaim that part of history. In working them into her own designs, she\\'s placed the power of the statement ruff in the hands of a young and diverse community of women. And the community has some noteworthy members: Gigi Hadid, Dua Lipa and Lizzo have all worn her pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nCelebrities aside, Adeola has made a point of surrounding herself with women. \"There would be no Tia without the women in my community who support me and who make things possible,\" she said. \"People go on the brand\\'s Instagram page and see these amazing pictures that they love, but they don\\'t realize there was a female makeup artist, there was a female hairstylist, there was a female photographer, there was a female set assistant. So all these women in my community come to mind when I\\'m making these clothes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdeola won\\'t be showing during New York Fashion Week this September, but she\\'s working on a short film to release later in the fall. With the challenges of the pandemic still ongoing, the path ahead isn\\'t clear cut for the designer, but one thing\\'s for sure: she\\'s determined to keep going and she\\'ll be leaving ruffles along the trail.',\n",

While early Parton favored down-home country checks, ruffled Grand Ole Opry-style gowns or bubblegum-pink jumpsuits, \\'80s Parton lit a rocket under her cowgirl look, multiplying the sequins and weaponizing the bimbo clichÃ©. \"I\\'m not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I\\'m not dumb... and I also know I\\'m not blonde,\" she is said to have quipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly Parton attends the LA premiere of \\'Steel Magnolias\\' in 1989 Credit: Ron Galella/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1980s, the singer who wrote the hits \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" on the same day had parlayed her success as a Nashville country artist into mainstream pop stardom, and set her sights on Hollywood. She made her feature debut in 1980 with office revenge fantasy \"9 to 5\" -- Parton has said she wrote its hit title song on set, tapping out the beat with those icepick acrylic nails to mimic a typewriter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Steel Magnolias\" was Parton\\'s fourth film, with an ensemble cast that included Shirley MacLaine, Sally Field, Julia Roberts and Daryl Hannah. Set amid the gossip and hairspray of a Louisiana beauty salon, on the surface it\\'s chick-flick fare. But beneath the wedding cakes and Christmas sweaters run some unexpectedly complex, dark currents -- not to mention some killer one-liners (\"In a good shoe I wear a size six, but a seven feels so good, I buy a size eight,\" Parton\\'s character Truvy says with a beaming smile).\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly Parton, circa 1975 Credit: Silver Screen Collection/Moviepix/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that respect, the film was much like Parton herself: her fountain of platinum hair and surplus silicone have always gone hand-in-hand with prodigious talent, shrewd business sense, and a conviction that all of these things can coexist in one bedazzled package.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut life wasn\\'t always so glitzy. It\\'s hard to begrudge the joy of a princess dress to a woman who used burnt matchsticks for eyeliner as a teenager. One of 12 children born in a two-room cabin at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains, in Locus Ridge, Tennessee, the tales from Parton\\'s penniless childhood have found their way into her lyrics: the dolls made from corn cobs, or the coats stitched from rags that got her bullied by her classmates. Her sharecropper father is said to have paid the doctor who delivered her with a sack of cornmeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly Parton during the photoshoot for the cover of her album \"Heartbreaker,\" 1978 Credit: Ed Caraeff/Morgan Media/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nParton debuted that crystal clear voice of hers at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville aged just 13. She was introduced by Johnny Cash, belted out the George Jones number \"You Gotta Be My Baby\" and got three encores.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteeped in the rich musical traditions of Appalachian bluegrass and folk murder ballads, her early \"sad-ass songs,\" as she has described them, were anything but fluffy. She sang about abortion, teenage pregnancy, stillbirth, and suicide -- topics that jar with her perennially sunny, rhinestone-studded Southern persona, but this riddle of seeming contradictions has been part of Parton\\'s appeal from the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly Parton poses for a portrait session in Los Angeles, 1978 Credit: Harry Langdon/Archive Photos/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the multi-hyphenated phenomenon has sold more than 100 million records, won 11 Grammys, and had 25 No.1 singles.

As she\\'s aged, her wardrobe has kept pace with the indefatigable diva, increasingly underlining her refusal to take herself too seriously: her looks have spanned from saloon madame to neon Peter Pan, mostly encasing her 5-foot frame as tightly as possible to accentuate her physics-defying bust-to-waist ratio. (\"I like to buy clothes that are two sizes too small and then take them in a little,\" goes another Dollyism.)\\r\\n\\r\\nShe\\'s been known to combine tassels, polka dots and stripes in a single outfit. She is that rare person who looks red-carpet-ready in triple denim. And she is the undisputed queen of matching her dress to her musical instrument -- Parton can play just about any, including the saxophone, guitar, banjo and, indeed, the pan-flute. Yet for all their cantilevered complexity, her costumes are still somewhat DIY -- she has said she buys many off the rack, adding her own adornments of beads and rhinestones.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly Parton performing on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm in Somerset, UK (2014) Credit: Yui Mok/PA Wire/AP\\r\\n\\r\\nParton wore white from head-to-toe at Glastonbury, the muddiest of festivals, and since drawing huge crowds there back in 2014, the Smoky Mountain Songbird, as she is sometimes called, has been embraced by a new generation of fans. In 2018, creative director Alessandro Michele paid homage by crowning her his muse at Gucci, emblazoning Parton\\'s face on the back of denim jackets and the front of pink sweatshirts for his Spring-Summer 2019 collection; at Bonnaroo 2019, rapper Post Malone stepped onstage in a suit plastered with her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a nine-episode NPR podcast about Parton\\'s life (\"Dolly Parton\\'s America\") and a campy Netflix series (\"Dolly Parton\\'s Heartstrings\") devoted to the stories behind her songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA model in a Dolly Parton portrait sweater at the Gucci show during Paris Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 74, she is increasingly considered a feminist icon, but Parton herself refuses to use the f-word. So her actions over her six-decade career will have to speak for themselves: this is a woman who stood up to Elvis and Colonel Parker by refusing to sign over the publishing rights to \"I Will Always Love You\" back in 1974, when the King wanted to record it -- a canny move considering the millions she has made from the song since.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom ditching her controlling mentor Porter Wagoner back in the \\'70s and steadfastly retaining the rights to her music, to her unapologetic nonchalance about cosmetic surgery today (\"If I see something sagging, bagging or dragging I\\'ll get it nipped, tucked or sucked\"), there\\'s little doubt that Dolly Parton has always been her own woman.',\n",

In its many hues, this color on lips has been a mighty cultural weapon, charged with thousands of centuries of meaning. \"Red lipstick is truly a way to trace cultural history and societal zeitgeist,\" Felder said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPortrait of beautician and cosmetics entrepreneur Elizabeth Arden (1947) Credit: Hulton Archive/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil lipstick was popularized in the early 20th century, red lips were often associated with morally dubious women: impolite, sexually amoral, even heretical. In the Dark Ages, red lips were seen as a sign of commingling with the devil. The makeup \"was associated with this mysterious, frightening femininity,\" Felder said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, Felder\\'s book explains, as the American suffrage movement adopted red lips, their international counterparts did, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs women\\'s rights movements spread across Europe, New Zealand and Australia, with British and American organizers often sharing tactics, from organizing marches, to hunger strikes, to more aggressive militant strategies. And this solidarity extended to their makeup. Inspired by her American counterparts, British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst favored a red lip, which helped spread the symbolic gesture among her fellow activists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough suffragettes popularized the red-lip look in their day, Felder notes that there was already momentum to normalize lipstick among women more generally, as they dropped restrictive corsets for brassieres, and started to adopt more streamlined silhouettes, designed by the likes of Coco Chanel.\\r\\n\\r\\nATS anti-aircraft spotter near London (1943) Credit: Reg Speller/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nFour female cipher and switchboard operators (1945) Credit: J. Wilds/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the suffragettes wore red lipstick, the exuberant flappers of the Roaring Twenties followed suit. And while suffragettes may not have been solely responsible for popularizing a painted lip, they embodied the idea of the \"modern woman\" in Europe and America, Felder pointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, red lips had their bold second act of defiance. Adolf Hitler \"famously hated red lipstick,\" Felder said. In Allied countries, wearing it became a sign of patriotism and a statement against facism. When taxes made lipstick prohibitively expensive in the UK, women stained their lips with beet juice instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs men went off to war and women filled their professional roles back home, they donned red lips to enter the workforce. It showed their resilience in the face of conflict, Felder explained, and offered a sense of normalcy in difficult times. \"It allowed women to retain a sense of their own self-identity from before the war.\" J.

Beauty brands had capitalized on the wartime trend, with Elizabeth Arden releasing \"Victory Red\" and Helena Rubenstein introducing \"Regimental Red,\" among others. But it was Arden who the American government asked to create a regulation lip and nail color for serving women. Her \"Montezuma Red\" matched and accentuated their uniforms\\' red piping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wearing red lipstick for a woman in that era was so linked to... a sense of feminine self-esteem,\" particularly, \"resilient and strong female self-esteem,\" said Felder, who has herself worn the beauty staple nearly every day since high school. After the war, classic Hollywood actresses like Elizabeth Taylor added a layer of glamour to the confident look.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeauty expert Helena Rubinstein illustrating how make-up can be applied to flatter individual contours (c. 1935) Credit: Orlando/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, other protest symbols for women\\'s empowerment have become widespread, notably the pink pussy hat that dominated the 2017 Women\\'s March; and the habit from \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\" which has been worn internationally for women\\'s causes, including pro-choice demonstrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet red lips still pack a punch.

In 1860, Britain\\'s High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, ordered troops to destroy both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace to avenge the killing of several British envoys to Beijing. By striking sites of cultural and imperial significance, Elgin wanted to chasten China.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with the Old Summer Palace still in ruins, he instead created a shrine that, more than a century on, is used by the country\\'s leadership to remind its people of past foreign aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors at the Old Summer Palace\\'s ruins in May 2020. Credit: Ju Huanzong/Xinhua/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, tens of thousands of visitors arrive to see its broken pillars and stone bricks, which dot an unkempt landscape of grass and weeds. They are potent symbols of China\\'s \"century of humiliation,\" the term Beijing uses to describe the period from the start of the Opium War in 1839 to the founding of the People\\'s Republic in 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the decades, scholars and experts in China have suggested that the palace be rebuilt in order to celebrate the grandeur of China\\'s past, thus banishing, rather than indulging, the memory of subjugation. The site could, ultimately, emulate the success of the neighboring Summer Palace, which was since rebuilt and has become one of China\\'s most popular visitor destinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA), the government agency responsible for protecting cultural relics, ruled out the latest restoration proposal in November.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site\\'s value lies in its \"historical status of being destroyed by foreign aggressors,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The site and its ruins serve as a warning to our descendants that they shall never forget the national humiliation.\" In a country where vestiges of the past are either zealously restored to their former glory or cleared to make way for new developments, the decision to leave the palace in ruins is conspicuous in its inaction. To some critics, the announcement was both a pointed political gesture and a symptom of patriotism that is not simply pro-China, but anti-foreign.\\r\\n\\r\\nA masterpiece of design\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the early 18th century, the Old Summer Palace grew into an exclusive getaway resort for the ruling elite of China\\'s Qing dynasty. Its architectural splendor has since been compared to France\\'s Palace of Versailles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was actually a combination of five garden residences of the Qing emperors,\" said Ying-chen Peng, a professor and Chinese art specialist at Washington D.C.\\'s American University, in a phone interview. \"And in each garden residence, you have clusters of buildings and even artificial lakes, ponds and water systems. It really was a gem of Chinese architecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA temple in the ruins of the Old Summer Palace, pictured circa 1860. Credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough construction started during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the early 1700s, the complex underwent a major expansion under his grandson the Qianlong Emperor\\'s rule. As well as increasing the complex in size, he also sought to diversify its architecture, which until then was typical of the country\\'s north, according to Peng.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He treated it as a miniature (version) of his empire. He made several trips to southern China ... and he was enchanted by its beauty,\" she said of the emperor\\'s so-called \"inspection tours,\" during which he would visit temples and mausoleums on official business as he consolidated power across the vast empire. \"After he returned from these trips, he would order his architects to replicate famous scenes or sites that he had seen and appreciated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples offered by Peng include Ruyuan (Garden of Ease), a replica of a garden in China\\'s former capital, Nanjing, and Anlanyuan (or Tranquil Wave Garden), which was based on a garden of the same name in Haining, Zhejiang province.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore unusually for the time, Qianlong also commissioned Jesuit missionaries to design several European-style palaces and fountains. These structures represent what Peng called \"hybrid\" architecture, which saw Western stone facades built over traditional Chinese wooden frames. (Because stone has proven more durable than wood, the remains of these Italian baroque-style buildings are now among the most prominent of the Old Summer Palace\\'s ruins, despite constituting a small minority of the original structures).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruins of a Western-style mansion pictured by German photographer Ernst Ohlmer in the 1870s, more than a decade after the European assault on the Old Summer Palace. Credit: Ernst Ohlmer\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even though they were missionaries, they were actually sort of \\'Renaissance men\\' by training -- musicians, painters or even engineers,\" Peng said. \"So, for the court, they were not treated as missionaries, but as people who could realize the Emperor\\'s fascination with exotic cultures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palace also served as a storage site for some of the nation\\'s most treasured art and artifacts. When Anglo-French soldiers arrived on Elgin\\'s orders to ransack it, they stole many of the items before burning the buildings to the ground. Perhaps most famous among the looted treasures were a dozen bronze animal heads, representing the 12 animals of the zodiac, which China has long sought to reclaim from overseas. (More than half have now made their way back to the country via auctions and donations, with their return often depicted in Chinese media as something of a national quest -- and even inspiring a 2012 Jackie Chan action movie on the subject. Five of the statues remain missing to this day.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the nearby Summer Palace (sometimes called the \"new\" Summer Palace, to avoid confusion) has benefited from multiple rebuilds since being ransacked. Nearly 30 years after the initial assault, Empress Dowager Cixi, then China\\'s de facto supreme leader, ordered some of its damaged imperial structures to be rebuilt, and gave them the name Yiheyuan (\"Garden of Good Health and Harmony\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revamped complex and its lavish gardens survived further turmoil and were added to UNESCO\\'s World Heritage List as a \"masterpiece of Chinese garden landscape design\" In 1998. The Old Summer Palace, however, was left to stagnate.\\r\\n\\r\\nRestoration debate\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 20th century, the Old Summer Palace had become a repository for building materials. Nearby structures were often made from, or at least decorated with, debris taken from the ruins. During Mao\\'s rule, which saw famines associated with the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution campaigns, farmers encroached on the land in desperate attempts to grow more food. It later became known as a place where artists lived and worked in the 1980s and early 1990s -- or \" squatted ,\" as the authorities saw it. They were eventually kicked out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the start of China\\'s reform era in the late 1970s, however, a number of grand plans have been floated to restore the Old Summer Palace. In 1984, a proposal to partially restore several pavilions emerged, and in the 1990s, there were also plans to use foreign investment to fund a miniature replica of the Old Summer Palace on the site, though neither scheme transpired. A restoration plan was finally approved in 2000, though archeological and environmental experts were \"quick to denounce it,\" according to a 2006 editorial in the Australian National University\\'s China Heritage Quarterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The contretemps about whether the park be preserved as it was, partially restored, partially rebuilt or fully restored raged in the print media for some months, and every time a new incident involving the gardens occurs the familiar battle lines are redrawn and the debate unfolds anew,\" it read.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors to the Old Summer Palace can still enjoy a boat trip on the complex\\'s network of lakes and waterways. Credit: Adrian Bradshaw/EPA/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest reconstruction proposal was championed by Yan Jianguo, a Beijing-based lawyer and delegate in China\\'s legislature, the National People\\'s Congress (NPC). In May 2020, at the NPC\\'s annual meeting, Yan argued that his vision for the project, which would include the extensive restoration of buildings and gardens, was essential for \"educational and patriotic purposes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChina\\'s leaders did not agree. And neither, perhaps, would the Chinese public. Although conducted around a decade ago, before the most recent rebuild proposal had emerged, an online poll by Sina news found that 77% of respondents opposed a rebuild, with many reportedly citing the potential cost of the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving said that, price concerns have hardly been prohibitive when it comes to major heritage projects in China. For instance, since 2005, the central government has allocated 1.9 billion yuan ($294 million) to a long-term project to restore the Great Wall section by section. The entire ancient town of Dukezong in Shangri-la county, Yunnan province, was meanwhile rebuilt at a cost of 1.2 billion yuan ($186 million) after a 2014 fire, according to Chinese state media.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the expense involved in rebuilding the entire Old Summer Palace could be uniquely astronomical. In 2008, a full-size replica of the complex -- essentially a large movie set with some surrounding landscaping -- was built at Hengdian World Studios in Zhejiang province at reported cost of 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) . And restoring the Beijing original would be \"definitely more expensive than that,\" Peng speculated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aerial view of a replica Old Summer Palace built at Hengdian World Studios at a reported cost of 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion). Credit: Jie Zhao/Corbis News/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking to the future\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Peng, the debate is not merely about whether to restore the palace, but how it might be done. She welcomed the rejection of the most recent proposal on the grounds that too many questions remain unresolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When we talk about reconstruction in architecture, it\\'s actually a package. It is not only about the structures per se,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do we deal with the interior?\" she offered as an example. \"Are we going to leave it empty, or are we going to try to replicate the interior design and furnish it with authentic items? If the project is to pursue that path, it would definitely be much more expensive and also controversial, because to what degree can we then call it an authentic construction?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther proposals have suggested simply building a museum to display and protect some of the treasures once housed at the palace. One structure on the site, the old Zhengjue Temple, was in fact recently rebuilt in order to exhibit one of the returned zodiac animal heads, while other government efforts have focused on landscaping and renovating the man-made lakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zhengjue Temple, one of the few parts of the Old Summer Palace to have undergone restoration. Credit: Li He/Xinhua/GettyImages\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter and historian of the Qing dynasty Jeremiah Jenne, who has been based in Beijing since 2002 and regularly visits the Old Summer Palace with students, believes that a complete rebuild is not required. But, he said, the history of the ruins could nonetheless be better explained to visitors. There is no central plaque or memorial, he noted, suggesting this could be achieved using virtual reality technology, which many museums are now using worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ruins have power, allowing you to use your imagination, which can add poignancy to the visitor experience,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts from Tsinghua University have gone some way toward recreating the Old Summer Palace in digital form. According to state media , researchers studied more than 10,000 historical files to make more than 4,000 design charts and 2,000 digital architecture models. Combined, they show at least 60% of the original structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors walk among the ruins of the Old Summer Palace in 2008. Credit: Michael Reynolds/EPA/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nThis kind of digital reimagining may be as close as we can get to experiencing the original splendor of the imperial complex, given that the most recent proposal for the Old Summer Palace -- among the most extensive and ambitious plans to restore the ruins to date -- appears to be dead in the water, But it probably won\\'t be long before another plan surfaces and reignites the debate of what to do with the site, and how to reinterpret China\\'s \"century of humiliation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m just glad that we have seen the dimension of the discussion grow more and more diverse,\" Peng said, \"because in the \\'80s and \\'90 it was just seen (in terms of) the shame of China\\'s past. Now, there\\'s a new take that sees it as (part of) the glory of China in the 18th century ... so it will be interesting to observe how it will be discussed in the future, and how those discussions reflect the Chinese mentality.\"',\n",

       " 'Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a country where over 80% of residents live in public housing, a government commitment to sustainable urban design could have huge implications. And when it\\'s a tropical country where convenience and air conditioning are a way of life, the impact could be greater still.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromising 42,000 new homes across five residential districts, the eco-town of Tengah -- the Malay word for \"middle,\" though it\\'s in the island\\'s western region -- will be the 24th new settlement built by Singapore\\'s government since World War II. It is, however, the first with centralized cooling, automated trash collection and a car-free town center, which conservationists hope offers a roadmap for slashing carbon emissions in the Southeast Asian city-state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development is being dubbed a \"forest town\" by officials, due to its abundant greenery and public gardens. Once home to brickmaking factories, and later used for military training, the 700-hectare (2.7-square-mile) site has been reclaimed by an extensive secondary forest in recent years. A 328-foot-wide ecological \"corridor\" will be maintained through its center, providing safe passage to wildlife and connecting a water catchment area on one side to a nature reserve on the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlanners say the town has been designed with pedestrians and cyclists in mind. Credit: Courtesy The Housing & Development Board\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project has proven a tabula rasa for urban planners advocating green design principles and \"smart\" technology, according to Chong Fook Loong, group director for research and planning at Singapore\\'s Housing and Development Board (HDB), the agency overseeing the country\\'s public housing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tengah is a clean slate,\" he said in a video interview, explaining that roads, parking and utilities are being pushed beneath the town center. \"We\\'re going for the ideal concept of segregation of traffic, (with) everything underground and then the ground level totally freed up for pedestrians -- for people. So, it\\'s a very safe environment for all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We want a town that allows walking and cycling in a very user-friendly manner,\" he added, saying that cycling has \"taken off\" in Singapore in the \"last three to five years especially.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master plan will see the installation of electric vehicle charging stations, while the streets are also being \"futureproofed\" to accommodate emerging technologies, Chong said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When we planned the road network, we envisaged a future where autonomous vehicles and self-driving vehicles will become a reality,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCooler by design\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough comparatively small, with a population of under 6 million people, Singapore\\'s per-capita emissions are higher than those of the UK, China and neighboring Malaysia, according to the country\\'s National Climate Change Secretariat\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s due, in part, to air conditioning, which accounts for more than a third of typical household energy consumption. Global warming will only exacerbate this dependence. The Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) has predicted that, by the end of this century, average daily temperatures in the city-state may be at least 34.1 degrees Celsius (93.4 degrees Fahrenheit) \"almost every day\" during the eight warmest months of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn artist\\'s impression of the 2.7-square-mile site. Credit: Courtesy The Housing & Development Board\\r\\n\\r\\nAs such, keeping cool will, increasingly, be a necessity for residents. Rather than demonizing air conditioning, Tengah\\'s planners have instead sought to reimagine it. Cold water, chilled using solar power, will be piped though the district\\'s homes, meaning residents don\\'t need to install inefficient outdoor AC condensers (though they can still control the temperature in their own apartments).\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the town\\'s energy provider, SP Group, this will generate carbon dioxide savings equivalent to taking 4,500 cars off the roads each year. The state-owned energy company reports that, of the apartments already sold in advance, 9 out of 10 future residents have signed up for centralized cooling.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlanners used computer modeling to simulate wind flow and heat gain across the town, helping to reduce the so-called urban heat island effect (whereby human activities and structures make urban areas notably warmer than the surrounding nature). Elsewhere, \"smart\" lights will switch off when public spaces are unoccupied, and trash will be stored centrally, with monitors detecting when garbage needs collecting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Instead of using a truck to collect garbage from every block, we will suck all the garbage through the pneumatic system to a chamber that serves several blocks,\" Chong said. \"From time to time, the (garbage) truck just needs to collect from the chamber.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the town\\'s five residential districts, known as the Plantation District, will offer community farming. Credit: Courtesy The Housing & Development Board\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 42,000 homes being built at Tengah, more than 70% will be made available through the HDB on long-term leases. Prices for two-bedroom apartments currently begin at just 108,000 Singapore dollars ($82,000), with the first apartments set to complete in 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll residents will have access to an app allowing them to monitor their energy and water usage. (\"You empower them to take control of where they can cut down their energy consumption,\" Chong said.) Digital displays in each block will meanwhile inform occupants of their collective environmental impact, which could even encourage competition between residential blocks, according to SP Group.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of whether the use of smart technology can significantly dent greenhouse gas emissions or not, engaging residents with their own consumption could instigate behavioral change, according to Perrine Hamel, an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University\\'s Asian School of the Environment. This, she added, is a crucial part of Singapore\\'s goal of reaching peak emissions by 2030 and reducing them thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thinking about food consumption and thinking about the way people use air conditioning is all part of (achieving climate targets),\" she said. \"Changing behavior is going to be an integral part of it and, of course, urban design is the first way to affect and change behavior.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDubbing the project a \"forest town,\" planners aim to retain some of the site\\'s natural greenery. Credit: Courtesy The Housing & Development Board\\r\\n\\r\\nConnecting with nature\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Hamel, the integration of nature and residential areas -- which creates \"more opportunities for people to interact with nature\" -- is where Tengah\\'s plan excels. In addition to the aforementioned forest corridor, the town\\'s residents will have access to community farming in the so-called Plantation District.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond promoting and protecting biodiversity, conserving nature on the site can lead to further behavioral change, Hamel said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are a lot of examples, from around the world, showing that changing our relationship with nature through everyday encounters does help people take environmental action,\" she said. \"On that front I think the biophilic design and (Tengah\\'s) master plan actually does a good job.\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nature Society Singapore (NSS) has nonetheless criticized the plan for conserving too little -- less than 10% -- of the site\\'s existing forest. The environmental group has proposed two additional \"core forest areas\" at either end of the green corridor to promote biodiversity and protect migratory species.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated video: How to design the perfect city\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government said it is \"refining\" its plan based the NSS report, though Singapore\\'s Land Transport Authority has since disclosed that even more of the remaining forest -- about 3% of the proposed corridor -- will be felled to make way for viaducts connecting the town to a nearby expressway.\\r\\n\\r\\n(In an email to CNN, the agency said it will later replant the trees in the cleared area and create \"suitable temporary wildlife crossings ... to provide a safe passage for animals during construction.\")\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, even Tengah\\'s critics have broadly welcomed the eco-town, with the NSS concluding its environmental critique by stating it is still \"heartened by this bold plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat these urban design initiatives mean for the rest of Singapore remains to be seen. When Tengah was first revealed in 2016, it was the first new town announced by Singapore\\'s government in two decades, meaning every other neighborhood was designed long before the era of autonomous vehicles and internet-enabled amenities. Chong readily admitted that \"it\\'s not so easy\" to retrofit underground road networks and pneumatic trash chutes in existing towns.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, he struck a positive note when asked what Tengah\\'s model offers future residential projects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We try to bring all the lessons forward -- whenever we can and to the best of our ability,\" he said. \"You look at Tengah and, in a nutshell, you\\'re seeing the future of what the (government) is trying to build: the future of towns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article was updated with the correct name of Tengah\\'s energy provider.',\n",

Kikutake\\'s vision imagined tree-like towers with pod dwellings that rose from floating concrete islands that would be built off the coast of Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the enthusiasm for megastructures fizzled out, science fiction has given them more space to flourish, from the Death Star in \"Star Wars\" to the futuristic reimagining of New York City in \"The Fifth Element,\" with its network of retrofitted, vertiginous buildings and vertical traffic patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rise of megastructures\\r\\n\\r\\nMegastructures were not simply ideas of fantasy. Addressing issues like affordable housing and diminishing open urban space, their proponents believed they were critical to future urban planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the movement\\'s most influential designs was Le Corbusier\\'s Fort l\\'Empereur concept from 1931. It\\'s a drawing that, Banham writes, is \"like a giant bookcase of reinforced concrete on the shelves of which the inhabitants have built two-story houses to suit their own tastes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIsraeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie designed Habitat 67 for Montreal\\'s 1967 Expo, where megastructure concepts were prominently featured.

Designed in 1964 by founding member Peter Cook, it visualized a vast metropolis of homes, businesses, and transportation that could all be moved and \"plugged into\" its infrastructural base by giant cranes. The city would be ever-changing to suit society\\'s needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrescient ideas or follies?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Looking back over the first half of the sixties and the characteristic megastructures of the period, it is noticeable -- alarming even -- how few of them actually offer any nut-and-bolt proposals as to how the transient elements should be secured to the megaform,\" Banham writes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the more modest proposals were built, including the Cumbernauld Town Centre in Scotland by Geoffrey Cocutt, and Tange\\'s Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in Kofu, Japan. But not all were warmly received.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cumbernauld Town Centre in Scotland features apartments, shops, a hotel, and other services.

       " 'Written by Alicia Lee, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ching chong eyes!\" That\\'s what elementary school kids used to call Sophie Wang. It was an insidious racist slur casually thrown around as they mocked her Asian ethnicity while pulling on the corner of their eyes. Upward for Japanese. To the side for Chinese. Downward for Korean.\\r\\n\\r\\nWang is now 17 and many years removed from the days when her Asian American identity was reduced to \"a single facial feature.\" And yet, scrolling through social media posts in recent months has brought those memories flooding back thanks to a new beauty trend: \"fox eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, people from all over the world have been posting videos and photos modeling the look -- using makeup and other tactics to emulate the lifted, so-called \"almond-shaped\" eyes of celebrities such as Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Megan Fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nFox-eye makeup tutorials show how to use a combination of eye shadow, eyeliner and fake eyelashes, to get a winged aesthetic. Tips include shaving off the tail end of eyebrows and redrawing them to appear straighter and angled upwards. Others have also suggested pulling hair back into a high ponytail or using tape to further lift the eyes. Accentuating eyes to appear slanted, or elongated in shape, creates a more sultry effect, according to some makeup artists creating the look.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to Wang and other Asian Americans, the \"migraine pose\" that sometimes accompanies these images -- using one or two hands to pull the eyes up by the temples to exaggerate the result -- is far too similar to the action used to demean them in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma Chamberlain, an influencer with 9.8 million followers on Instagram, was recently criticized for posting a picture that showed her striking this pose while sticking out her tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fans rushed to defend her, commenting that those that felt offended were \"overreacting.\" Chamberlain later deleted the picture and apologized , saying it wasn\\'t her \"intention\" to pose in an \"insensitive way\" and that she was \"so sorry to those who were hurt by it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the damage had already been done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They mock my eyes then say ching chong call me a dog eater and then call me a ch*nk. Like why would you think I\\'d be fine with Emma\\'s post?\" one person tweeted . \"Obviously if she gets to do slant eyes whilst getting praised but it\\'s my natural eye shape and I\\'m getting discriminated (of course) I\\'m mad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a new trend that brings out old stereotypes and old taunts,\" Wang said in a phone interview. \"Because it makes people like me feel uncomfortable and (to) some degree annoyed, it\\'s time to talk about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat people don\\'t understand, Wang wrote in an op-ed for student-run newspaper Stanford Daily in July, is that the gesture has \"racially-charged historical weight,\" referring to past satirical depictions of Asians in Western media -- caricatures poking fun at facial features to portray them as \"barbaric,\" \"subhuman\" and inferior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet in the 21st century, these Asian features have suddenly transformed into beauty trends for non-Asian people,\" she wrote, adding that the trend is an act of cultural appropriation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppropriating Asian eyes\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly H. Chong, a sociology professor at the University of Kansas, defines cultural appropriation as the adoption, often unacknowledged or inappropriate, of the ideas, practices, customs and cultural identity markers of one group by members of another group whom have greater privilege or power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cultural influencers from the dominant group legitimize it as a cool, style \\'trend,\\' and in the process exoticizes and eroticizes it,\" Chong added in an e-mail interview. Even the term \"almond eyes,\" she says, which is being used to describe the shape of fox eyes, has long been used to describe the shape of Asian eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eyes are not a trend,\" by Chungi Yoo, an illustrator based in Frankfurt, Germany. Credit: Courtesy @chungiyoo\\r\\n\\r\\nShe points to Hollywood\\'s uncomfortable past in the appropriating the shape of Asian eyes. In the early 1930s, makeup artist Cecil Holland used techniques -- some, similar to creating fox eyes today -- to transform White actors into villainous Asian characters, like Fu Manchu. And Mickey Rooney, the White actor playing the part of Holly Golightly\\'s thickly-accented Japanese neighbor in \"Breakfast at Tiffany\\'s\" cemented \"the buck-toothed, slit-eyed Asian man look\" in the popular imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nTikTok user @LeahMelle, whose video denouncing the fox-eye look went viral, said she couldn\\'t believe that such a trend could be so popular nowadays.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This wasn\\'t some dated movie where you could blame the distorted norms of the time period. This was happening now. And it was still viewed as acceptable,\" she wrote in an email.\\r\\n\\r\\nMyrna Loy, a White actress, portrayed the depraved daughter of Fu Manchu in \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" (1932). Credit: Bettmann/Bettmann/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most beauty trends, the craze for fox eyes will eventually subside, and has begun to already since it first came about earlier this year. But that\\'s exactly the problem, according to Stephanie Hu, founder of Dear Asian Youth, a California-based organization that encourages Asian activism.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an Instagram post , entitled \"The problem with the #FoxEye trend,\" the organization wrote, \"While it may not have originated from a place of ill-intent, it appropriates our eyes and is ignorant of past racism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It really feels like this is a temporary trend,\" Hu said, adding that she believes Asians\\' eye shapes aren\\'t just something to be casually adopted and then \"given back\" when the trend is over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our eyes are something that we have to live with every day,\" Hu said in a phone interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nPressure to assimilate\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Asians have long felt the pressure to alter the shape of their eyes, and to make them appear larger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlepharoplasty is used to create double eyelids, or a supratarsal eyelid crease. It\\'s one of the most common cosmetic procedures in East Asian countries, as well as among Asian Americans. But when it was first popularized, in the early 1950s, it was used as a tool for Korean women to assimilate in the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nKorean plastic surgeon Kim Byung-gun (not pictured) demonstrates the effect of \"double eyelid surgery,\" which adds a crease to the eyelids to make the patient\\'s eyes appear larger. Credit: Nir Elias/Reuters\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Korea Herald , American military plastic surgeon Dr. David Ralph Millard first performed the surgery during the Korean War. His first patients were Korean war brides who had married American soldiers. Because the brides were considered \"both cultural and racial threats to the US,\" the paper wrote, many of them would get the surgery in an effort to assimilate and appear \"less threatening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surgically altering the \\'slanted\\' eyes became a mark of a \\'good\\' and trustworthy Asian, one whose modification of the face provided a comforting illustration of the pliable Asian, and served as evidence of the US as the model and Asia as the mimic,\" wrote Taeyon Kim, then a PhD student at Bowling Green State University, in her 2005 dissertation, which is quoted in the article.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While it is primarily beauty that motivates (today\\'s women\\'s) desire to alter their eyes, this beauty is built on a legacy of history of Western science and race that privileged the white body as the normal, beautiful body,\" Kim wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat pressure to assimilate has carried to recent decades. In 2013, TV personality and news anchor Julie Chen, revealed on \"The Talk\" that she had blepharoplasty done as a 25-year-old, to get ahead in her career. A former boss had told her that \"Asian eyes\" made her look \"disinterested\" and \"bored.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter surgery, Chen said, \"I did look better, at least by societal standards,\" in a 2016 op-ed for Glamour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen social trends go viral\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is deemed attractive these days is significantly influenced by social media, where beauty trends can quickly go viral, and arguably just as quickly become destructive to a person\\'s confidence and self worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tiktok, the hashtag #foxeye has already accumulated 72.8 million views, while on Instagram, the hashtag #foxeyes has more than 70,000 posts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsian American makeup artist Marc Reagan said when he first spotted the fox eye trend, he didn\\'t think it was problematic. He simply saw it as a set of makeup techniques to enhance the eyes and to exaggerate an almond shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it \"morphed into something different,\" he said, noting that it became offensive when people started adding the gesture of pulling up at the temples.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I absolutely think that everyone needs to pause before they take (that) action,\" Reagan said in a phone interview. \"Everyone needs to pause, take a step back: \\'Is this something that could be interpreted the wrong way?\\' \\'Am I taking it down the path where it turns from being a simple makeup trend into appropriation?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReagan added he isn\\'t surprised that some people are feeling hurt by the trend, especially in light of the pandemic, when East Asians have been increasingly targeted with racist attacks or slurs . Some people, including the US president have referred to Covid-19 as the \"China virus\" or \"kung flu .\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t be surprised that someone\\'s going to be offended by you exaggerating a feature on your face that mimics something that they\\'ve been made fun of or discriminated against for. So we are (living) in a really sensitive time and those types of things need to be taken (into consideration) every single day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTop image caption: Screenshot from Instagram of the #foxeyes hashtag.',\n",
       " 'Written by Tufayel Ahmed, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen director David Fincher enlisted his frequent collaborator, costume designer Trish Summerville, for his new movie \"Mank\"-- a biopic on the screenwriter behind the iconic 1941 film \"Citizen Kane\" -- she knew it was going to be her most challenging assignment for him to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummerville, who previously worked with Fincher on the crime thrillers \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\" from 2011 and \"Gone Girl\" from 2014, was tasked with recreating the glamor of 1930s Hollywood, from its backlot meetings to its lavish soirees, without using a drop of color.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman travel back to the Golden Age of cinema for \"Mank.\" Credit: Netflix\\r\\n\\r\\nFincher and cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt strove for authenticity of the era by closely replicating the look and feel of Old Hollywood talking pictures -- right down to shooting \"Mank\" entirely in black and white, or \"Fincher-vision,\" as Summerville described it over the phone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s never going to be just black-and-white. It\\'s his vision of what black-and-white is,\" she said of the film, which takes on sumptuous noir tones and unfolds in arresting continuous shots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mank,\" which opened to a limited run in theaters in November and is out on Netflix today, is equally as buzzy a project as Summerville and Fincher\\'s previous collaborations. \"Citizen Kane\" is considered one of the greatest movies of all time, and the film delves into the events and people screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (played by Gary Oldman) supposedly drew inspiration from while writing the script. \"Mank\" features some of the biggest stars of the era including \"Kane\" director Orson Welles (Tom Burke) and Hollywood starlet Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried).\\r\\n\\r\\nVibrancy without color\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Hollywood enters awards season, \"Mank\" is being tipped as an early favorite for next year\\'s Oscars. Some of the praise is down to Summerville\\'s costumes.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe not only had to ensure that all of the costumes accurately reflected the show-stopping gowns worn by the likes of Davies and actress Bette Davis, but that they dazzled even in black-and-white. Ironically, Summerville had to think more about color than ever before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even if it is black-and-white, you can\\'t just use just black and just white because it goes really flat (on screen) and everything looks the same,\" she explained. \"It was about figuring out which colors and varying tones read really well on screen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the film was shot entirely in black-and-white, color was important to the costume design, as different hues translate to different black and gray tones. Credit: Netflix\\r\\n\\r\\nSummerville tried to stay \"authentic to what the color palette was then,\" she said, opting for both muted tones and jewel tones, which she said achieved a \"variance of white to off-white to gray to black-and-whites that would read differently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn set, there was a vibrant range of hues, particularly when it came to party scenes at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California, where Davies and her newspaper tycoon paramour William Randolph Hearst (played by Charles Dance) held famous soirees for Hollywood\\'s biggest stars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lot of the dresses and gowns are really intense colors like chartreuse, salmon and acidy greens and mangos,\" said Summerville.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrish Summerville was tasked with emulating the looks of Old Hollywood stars like Marion Davies. Credit: Hulton Archive/Archive Photos/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of bold colors presented a conundrum in itself. Summerville had to be mindful that the colors used didn\\'t distract the actors on set and appeased Fincher\\'s sensibilities, too. \"Dave isn\\'t a big fan of color,\" Summerville said. \"There\\'s certain colors he doesn\\'t like because they can draw your eye (away from the scene).\" The director doesn\\'t like red, for instance, she said, but red can create a rich black on camera, while pinks can sub in for gray.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother challenge, she said, was avoiding loud prints and patterns that can look \"confetti-like\" on screen. \"We didn\\'t want everything to be solid because there was a lot of printing happening in women\\'s clothing and men\\'s ties at the time, so we tried to find tonally what was complimentary in black-and-white.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Hollywood details\\r\\n\\r\\nBefitting a movie star of Davies\\' fame and wealth, Seyfried wears some of the most elaborate costumes in \"Mank.\" \"She\\'s one of the few women that repeats throughout (the movie) and is in these big party scenes holding her own in political conversations,\" said Summerville. \"I wanted your eye to be drawn to her because it\\'s such a male-heavy film.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one scene Seyfried wears a stunning gold, metallic lamÃ© dress -- a popular material for women\\'s gowns and evening at the time -- and later she is seen in a circus-inspired costume with palazzo-style pants at an annual party held at Hearst Castle. Summerville replicated the outfit Davies actually wore to the A-list soiree she and Hearst threw in 1937, based on photos of the actress there on a carousel horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummerville said she wanted viewers to be drawn to Seyfriend as she navigates the \"male-heavy\" world of \"Mank.\" Credit: Netflix\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We just made slight improvements on it, like adding more rhinestones and Swarovski crystals down the front,\" said Summerville. \"I really wanted her to wear the pants ... There\\'s other pictures where Marion did wear pants quite often, which was rare for a woman of her age and in that time period, and because she was around William Hearst, who was very traditional and old-fashioned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferentiating the various men in the film was more difficult. Mank and his cohorts wore very traditional tailoring for the time, so Summerville infused a little bit of each character into their style. In the film, Oldman, for example, appears quite disheveled and showing signs of a paunchy stomach from excessive drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummerville gave authenticity to her designs by looking at the details of 1930s styles and the different techniques used to make the garments. Credit: Netflix\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His shirts weren\\'t perfectly pressed -- they probably started off pressed in the morning, but as his day progressed he became more disheveled,\" explained Summerville. \"He wears his tie loosened a lot, which wasn\\'t very common then, and we had his pants underneath his belly to show his weight gain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSummerville\\'s foray into 1930s fashion gave the costume designer a sense of the workmanship that went into dressmaking and tailoring at the time. \"I really loved looking at old, authentic period clothing -- the sleeves on a lot of women\\'s clothing were really intricate,\" she said. \"And how pockets and waistbands were sewn into men\\'s trousers used different techniques that aren\\'t done now at all. Clothing then was made with a lot of pride and quality put into it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe costume designer also took away from \"Mank\" a deeper appreciation for the laborious work her costume department peers would have done in 1930s Hollywood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The(re\\'s) intricacy in the fabrics and the stoning that went into things,\" she said. \"And it was made head to toe, from milliners to cobblers.\"',\n",
       " 'Written by Nick Glass, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nTracey Emin is utterly fearless. Just months after undergoing extensive surgery to treat an aggressive bladder cancer, the famed British artist, who has been remarkably candid about the entire ordeal, has two new shows in London. And in line with her highly personal -- and often controversial -- art practice, her dual exhibition with Expressionist painter Edvard Munch is one of naked bodies, gestural brushstrokes and raw emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmin has been mad about Munch for 40 years. She and her artistic hero were born a century apart -- he in 1863, she in 1963 -- but their works appear together in \"The Loneliness of the Soul,\" at London\\'s Royal Academy of Arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTracey Emin returns to art after cancer treatment\\r\\n\\r\\nFeaturing 19 oils and watercolors by him and some 25 works by her -- a mix of paintings, neon and sculpture -- both bodies of work explore profound grief and loss. Emin was responsible for selecting which Munch works to display alongside her own, and she chooses many of his canvases featuring women to accompany her own autobiographical works.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Emin\\'s second new show, at London\\'s White Cube gallery, includes a short Super-8 film from 1998 in tribute to the Expressionist painter, titled \"Homage to Edvard Munch and All My Dead Children.\" In it, Emin crouches naked on a pier by the sea and lets out a prolonged and nerve-jangling scream. Of course, Munch\\'s most famous work is \"The Scream\" -- he painted a total of four versions between 1893 and 1910. One sold at auction in 2012 for almost $120 million. Emin regards Munch as \"absolutely timeless,\" she said when I interviewed her, dealing with \"love, passion, jealousy, fear and death -- everything all of us have to live through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was like something out of a really bad black-humored film.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEmin has had a lot to live through these past few months. Over the summer, the brutal diagnosis she received was all too familiar -- squamous-cell bladder cancer was the same type that killed her mother in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artist was alone in her studio when the doctor phoned her with the result. \"I laughed. I laughed. I was shocked,\" she said of her initial reaction. \"There was a good chance I wasn\\'t going to make it. It was all reliant on the surgery. I had a fantastic surgeon luckily enough,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdvard Munch\\'s \"The Scream\" is the Norwegian artist\\'s most famous motif. Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nEmin underwent a six-and-a-half-hour operation in July. She has never been reticent about personal details: the team of 12 surgeons removed her bladder, urethra, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, part of her colon and part of her vagina. But the crucial news was that the cancer hadn\\'t spread to her lymph nodes. Her ordeal and her willingness to talk about it propelled her onto the front page of newspapers while cancer charities have praised her for talking so frankly about it all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have had a lot of horrible things happen to me in my life and they have put me in good stead for this moment,\" she said. \"I have my sense of humor. I have my will to live and survive.\" She says without hesitation that she\\'s not afraid of death, and then she cheerfully tells an anecdote about her new colostomy bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmin\\'s work has always been deeply personal and spans paintings, sculpture, neon and video. Credit: David Parry\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, she had fiercely resisted the idea. She asked her surgeon if there was another option. \"And he goes, \\'Yeah,\\'\\'\\' she recalled. \"And I went, \\'What is it? I\\'ll do that.\\' And he said: \\'It\\'s death!\\' And I went: \\'\\'I\\'ll take the bag!\\'\" She laughed. \"I couldn\\'t believe it. It was like something out of a really bad black-humored film.\" For the foreseeable future, Tracey will have scans every few months.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmin has always been a divisive figure, her art and persona prompting strong reactions. She feels that back in the 1990s, the critics were both unfair and sexist. \"I was just considered to be a loud-mouthed screaming girl, a woman with big tits and no brain,\" she told writer and curator Kenny Schachter in a video interview last month. But over time, her career has gone from strength to strength. Her best-known piece, \"My Bed\" from 1998 -- an installation of a box-framed bed with rumpled, stained sheets, discarded condoms, empty vodka bottles and cigarette packs -- sold at auction in 2014 for $3.77 million.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(I have a) really hard time when my shows open because people aren\\'t always that kind to me,\" she said. She\\'s hoping that given \"the cancer thing,\" that this time, they won\\'t \"pick on me so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA whirlwind of emotion\\r\\n\\r\\nEmin\\'s openness about her life has always been reflected in her artwork. In \"The Loneliness of the Soul,\" what is obviously shared between her and Munch is their common intensity and the confessional nature of their art.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunch\\'s paintings like \"Consolation,\" and \"Weeping Women\" show the figures of women bent over with emotion in small, intimate compositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer paintings are bigger than his -- some 9 feet by 6 feet -- and her acrylic palate much sparer in red, pink, blue and black. She paints herself, nude, legs spread wide, sometimes bleeding. Lovers grapple during sex. Collectively, there is a sense of love and loss and abandonment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Emin\\'s \"My Bed\" (1998), empty alcohol bottles, cigarettes, stained sheets and worn underwear are scattered on and around the bed. According to Emin the bed was in the same state as it had been in her own bedroom while she was battling with depression. Credit: Courtesy of the Saatchi Gallery, London\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as with Munch, her titles are important, like with \"I never Asked to Fall in Love - You made me Feel like This\" from 2018. The painting is made in splashes, flurries and drips of red and pink. In \"The Last of My Kind,\" from 2019, a naked female figure faces the viewer, face blurred, hemmed in by a scrawl of words. Part of it reads: \"I think I am trapped until I die. I am getting old now but not as old as my broken f*cked up vagina...I am the Last of my Kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is unquestionably a sense of exorcism in Emin\\'s art. When she\\'s painting, \"the emotion that comes out of me is like a whirlwind, like a tornado,\\'\" she described to Schachter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am The Last of my Kind,\" (2019) and \"You Came,\" (2018) at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. Credit: David Parry\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked her to describe her process. \"If you were in my studio and I was about to paint, you\\'d probably see me procrastinating for about two or three hours, fall asleep, muck around, everything but painting,\" she said. \"But then you\\'d see me get up and throw myself at the canvas and just within two seconds, like shock you. I just do a big drawing. I\\'d throw lots of paint at it. I\\'d attack it like a sort of banshee, definitely out of control. I love it. It\\'s like having the best sex in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNext summer, an expanded version of the Emin/Munch show will open at the new Munch Museum in Oslo. It will include \"My Bed,\" her Super-8 homage to Munch and a huge new bronze sculpture, \"The Mother\" of a naked female figure, cradling \"an absent form,\" according to White Cube.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmin is still convalescing and impatient for her energy to return, but is \"really looking forward to going crazy with a paint brush\" soon, she said. Munch died in Nazi-occupied Norway in 1944 at 80 years old. Emin says that she plans to live just as long, if not longer.',\n",

But in his unsparing new book, \" As a curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum of the University of Oxford, Dan Hicks presides over one of the world\\'s largest collections ofartifacts looted from Benin.But in his unsparing new book, \" The Brutish Museums ,\" he makes a case for their return, while calling for greater honesty in the telling of colonial history and the enabling role played by museums like his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nHicks says his position was partly informed by the \" Rhodes Must Fall \" movement, which erupted in South Africa in 2015 and spread to the University of Oxford, where he serves as a professor of contemporary archeology. Students demanded the removal of a statue of colonial tycoon Cecil Rhodes within a wider \"decolonization\" campaign that denounced the Pitt Rivers Museum as \"one of the most violent spaces in Oxford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA demonstration takes place opposite a statue of Cecil Rhodes at the University of Oxford. Credit: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nHicks accepts the charge. The museum was a \"weapon\" -- as integral to imperial domination as the Maxim gun, he writes --- that was used to \"legitimize, extend and naturalize new extremes of violence within corporate colonialism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions reduced cultures to trophies in glass cases in order \"to tell the story of the victory of Europeans over Africans,\" he said in a phone interview. They were used \"to inspire colonial administrators and soldiers ... who fought these wars and thought they were doing so in the name of civilization.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bronzes were feted as masterpieces but they were presented as the work of inferiors. Hicks quotes one British Museum curator saying that he was \"puzzled to account for so highly developed an art among a race so entirely barbarous as were the Bini,\" referring to the ethnic group -- also known as the Edo people -- that founded the Kingdom of Benin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author draws a parallel between these colonial-era art displays and the pseudoscientific exhibitions that compared fake skulls as evidence of racial hierarchies and were phased out after World War II due to their association with fascism. He believes the ongoing display of looted heritage amounts to a continued celebration of violence and white supremacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenin Bronzes on display at the British Museum, which holds the world\\'s largest collection.

(The Kingdom of Benin is located in what is now the southern Nigerian state of Edo.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDrawing on accounts from soldiers and British officials, the author dismantles myths to tell a story of brutality and greed. Officially, the \"punitive expedition\" of 1897 was a response to an attack on a convoy led by Captain James Phillips, consul-general of the Niger Coast Protectorate, a month earlier. Phillips and several of his men were killed by Bini troops while on a mission to, ostensibly, lobby the king of Benin over access to the valuable palm oil and rubber in his territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut documents from Protectorate leaders show plans for a punitive expedition were discussed as early as 1892. Phillips himself had written to Prime Minister Lord Salisbury requesting weapons for an invasion of Benin to ease the flow of commerce. In this light, Hicks argues the mission was designed to provide a pretext for attack. He also shows that such a large British force, which he estimates at around 5,000 men with 10 warships and 38 Maxim guns, could not have been assembled in the month between expeditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA meeting between Benin chiefs and Vice-Consul Henry Galway of the Niger Coast Protectorate in 1892.

But Hicks disputes their supposed heroism. Accounts from military leaders describe indiscriminate slaughter from a safe distance, while warships destroyed towns and villages along their route. Eight British deaths were reported to the Houses of Parliament but no effort was made to tally Bini losses, despite inquiries from ministers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of heritage was also incalculable. The earthworks of Benin were once an archeological marvel comprising a 16,000-kilometer network of walls that formed one of the world\\'s largest man-made structures. They were -- along with palaces, homes and religious sites -- reduced to rubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish officials and museums downplayed the destruction and claimed damage was accidental. This is contradicted by the systematic approach Hicks reveals in soldiers\\' diaries. \"Work to be done Saturday February 20th,\" wrote Captain Egerton, chief of staff for the expedition. \"Walls and houses to be knocked down. Queen Mother\\'s house to be burnt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficially, looted artifacts were sold to pay the expedition costs. But Hicks cites a curator at the British Museum who later admitted much of the take was \"shared out carefully among the officers.\" A museum catalog revealed that bronzes were acquired \"via the liquidation of estates of old soldiers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAltarpiece taken from Benin by Admiral George Leclerc Egerton, now at the Pitt Rivers Museum. Credit: Pitt Rivers Museum/Dumas-Egerton Trust\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing movement\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Benin\\'s experience may have been exceptional for the scale of destruction and the heritage lost, Hicks situates it within the routine practice of colonial pillaging during the \"scramble for Africa,\" as imperial powers carved up the continent into separate spheres of influence from the late 19th century to the breakout of World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout this period, many prized African artifacts arrived in Western museums via violent conquest, from sculptures taken by France in the sacking of Abomey, to the gold looted by British soldiers from the Asante Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\ndispossessed nations have Hicks challenges museums like his to address and reject rather than defend the legacies of colonialism in their collections. \"The Brutish Museums\" is especially timely, as calls for the reclamation of stolen heritage grow louder in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Activists have taken direct action to reclaim lost treasures, anddispossessed nations have escalated long-running campaigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nof the \"material cultural legacy\" of sub-Saharan Africa lies outside the continent and recommended that artifacts in France -- a total of around 90,000 pieces -- be made subject to return upon request. The message is being heard around Europe. Germany recently established guidelines for restitution. The 2018 Sarr-Savoy report , commissioned by the French government, meanwhile found that 90%of the \"material cultural legacy\" of sub-Saharan Africa lies outside the continent and recommendedthat artifacts in France -- a total of around 90,000 pieces -- be made subject to return upon request.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut action has been slow to materialize. France has thus far authorized the return of just 27 pieces to Benin and Senegal. European museums have offered loans rather than permanent returns, while Nigeria\\'s government has resorted to buying Benin Bronzes at a premium from auctions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHicks blames intransigence from museums. \"As a sector, our leadership has tried to sweat this one out,\" he said, while his book invites readers to help break the impasse by joining the movement for restitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quai Branly Museum in Paris holds the largest collection of African heritage artifacts in France. A government report has recommended these be made subject to restitution. Credit: FRED DUFOUR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nResisting returns\\r\\n\\r\\nArguments against restitution have evolved since 1981, when the British Museum reportedly claimed the Benin Bronzes were acquired legally as \"the British were the legitimate authority.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, curators have argued that they are better placed to showcase cultural heritage. In 2003, the British Museum\\'s director made a case against returns on the basis that artifacts should be \"housed in safety, conserved, curated, researched, exhibited and made available to the widest possible public.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British have also previously resisted requests to loan bronzes to Nigeria, claiming the pieces were too fragile to travel. Concerns have been raised about the standard of facilities to house the bronzes -- although the British Museum has recently helped secure funding for a new museum in Benin City, Nigeria.\\r\\n\\r\\nHicks notes that bronzes preserved for centuries at Benin\\'s royal court have only been lost, neglected or destroyed since arriving in London. His research led to the discovery of sculptures abandoned in broom cupboards and used as doorstops, and ivory artifacts repurposed as piano keys and billiard balls.\\r\\n\\r\\n. The authors say such that claims will likely focus on a small proportion of objects with \"high symbolic value.\" French curators have pushed back against the Sarr-Savoy report\\'s recommendations, which could leave much of their collections vulnerable to restitutionThe authors say such fears are unwarranted , andthat claims will likely focus on a small proportionof objects with \"high symbolic value.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ndispersing their collections. But Hicks\\' analysis shows that hundreds of bronzes are held outside of national museums governed by such laws. He argues that national museums should establish a restitution framework for colonial loot similar to the Museums cite de-accession laws that prevent them fromdispersing their collections. But Hicks\\' analysis shows that hundreds of bronzes are held outside of national museums governed by such laws. He argues that national museums should establish a restitution framework for colonial loot similar to the Washington Principles , which require museums to pro-actively identify and return art that was taken by the Nazis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurators have also suggested compromises such as adding context about how items were acquired to their exhibits. Director of the V&A, Tristram Hunt, recently wrote in Prospect magazine that he had changed how the museum presents items from the Asante Empire so as to \"explain their place within the ugly history of imperial trophy hunting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGhana has sought the return of gold looted from the Asante empire. British museums offer a compromise of adding new context to such exhibits. Credit: WIKI COMMONS/Picasa\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road ahead\\r\\n\\r\\nHicks dismisses \"relabeling\" as a superficial ploy to avoid questions of ownership and meaningful action. He hopes to eventually see museums \"where nothing is stolen, where everything is present with the consent of all parties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should begin with curatorial work for African collections that has long been neglected, he said, in order to establish exactly which pieces are held where. His book features an inventory of Benin Bronzes in an attempt to track down those that are still missing. Hicks also plans to create databases for other lost works, and he has launched a project to document cases of looting on military expeditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere an item\\'s provenance is established, the author and curator suggests that restitution claims proceed on a case-by-case basis through dialogue between claimants and museum trustees. Where objects are not sought for immediate return, a transfer of ownership could signal recognition of their origin in lieu of restitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nsaid, arguing that the progress of museums across the continent, from The priority for European curators should be to enable African scholars to study African heritage, hesaid, arguing that the progress of museums across the continent, from Dakar to Benin City , is a trend to be supported rather than obstructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHicks also believes Western museums can still play an important role providing education about the world\\'s cultures, but only if they embrace radical change.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The consequence of ignoring these questions is losing our social legitimacy,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'Written by Rosalind Jana, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Surrealist artist Salvador DalÃ\\xad first put a lobster on a dress, he wanted to be provocative. It worked. His 1937 collaboration with boundary pushing fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli caused consternation. The silk organza A-line gown they created together, subsequently worn by Wallis Simpson in the pages of Vogue, elicited shock, head scratching, and plenty of voluble conversation from the fashion world. Apparently DalÃ\\xad was disappointed though. He felt that the dress was missing one final touch: a dash of mayonnaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duchess of Windsor wearing a white Schiaparelli dress. Credit: Cecil Beaton/Conde Nast Collection/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s hard in the present day to imagine a lobster on a dress being such a big deal. It\\'s the kind of print you could easily find now, adorning everything from loafers to smocks. Henrik Vibskov\\'s Spring-Summer 2020 collection featured plenty of pink and red crustaceans, for example, and Louis Vuitton\\'s Autumn-Winter 2020 menswear show saw models stride down the catwalk wearing white fluffy coats decorated with oversized, similarly plush lobsters.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouis Vuitton Spring-Summer 2021 Men\\'s show. Credit: Yanshan Zhang/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason we now find such imagery so commonplace is, in part, thanks to a 20th century avant garde art movement: Surrealism. With an emphasis on the untapped power of dreams and a drive to create fantastical art through techniques such as automatism (spontaneous, uninhibited writing and artwork) and juxtapositions of unlikely images Surrealism aimed to release the unconscious mind and, in doing so, set loose the imagination. It was deeply influenced by Freud\\'s writing about hidden desires and feelings, as well as other psychological and political thinkers including Karl Marx.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word itself was first used in 1917, but it really came to the fore as movement in the 1920s. In the 1930s. Plenty of Surrealism\\'s key proponents turned to design, creating extraordinary, often startling objects. A select few embraced fashion too. Schiaparelli collaborated with both DalÃ\\xad and fellow artist MÃ©ret Oppenheim, who would go on to incorporate clothes to unnerving ends in her own work, such as gloves adorned with fur and veins . Joan MirÃ³ designed bright, brash costumes for the Ballet Russes. Eileen Agar devised playful designs like her 1936 \"Ceremonial Hat for Eating Bouillabaisse,\" which featured seashore detritus including a lobster\\'s tail and a fishing net. This back and forth traffic between art and fashion manifested in other ways too. Photographers including Man Ray and Lee Miller brought a Surrealist eye to their fashion photography, while figures such as painter Leonor Fini developed a reputation for outrageous costuming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadelle Hegeler shows off jewelry by Salvadore Dali in New York. Credit: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of their experiments have since bled through to mainstream fashion. Elsa Schiaparelli\\'s 1938 padded skeleton dress has inspired countless designs featuring bones, spines, hearts and other things usually kept beneath the skin, with Alexander McQueen\\'s Spring- Summer 1998 spine corset in collaboration with jeweler Shaun Leane a particularly notable example. Elsewhere, the movement\\'s desire to upend the normal has been reflected in shows as disparate as Hussein Chalayan\\'s Autumn-Winter 2000 catwalk show featuring tables that turned into skirts and Victor & Rolf\\'s Spring-Summer 2010 collection of tulle ball-gowns with huge cut-away holes.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor & Rolf Spring Spring-Summer 2010 show. Credit: Dominique Charriau/WireImage/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, designers have demonstrated a renewed kinship to the art movement. Last year several labels cited Surrealist creators as major reference points. Simone Rocha\\'s Autumn-Winter 2019 show drew on Louise Bourgeois\\' fearless approach to the female body, the designer subsequently working with art gallery Hauser & Wirth later that same year to release a set of earrings directly inspired by Bourgeois\\' fabric sculptures. Fellow designers Eudon Choi and Roland Mouret also respectively cited MÃ©ret Oppenheim and Lee Miller as key figures for their Autumn-Winter 2019 shows. Dior, too, has repeatedly rummaged through Surrealist history, with head designer Maria Grazia Chiuri name-checking artists and photographers including Leonor Fini, Leonora Carrington, and Dora Maar in recent seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimone Rocha Autumn-Winter 2020 show. Credit: Luke Walker/BFC/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of this revived interest can almost certainly be traced to the art world\\'s renewed focus on the work of female Surrealists, many of whom have been celebrated in retrospectives and other exhibitions after decades of neglect. This Surrealist preoccupation is even more fitting against the backdrop of a year of tumult in which our own understanding of normality has been ruptured.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the summer Dior\\'s Autumn-Winter 2020 couture collection came complete with a photographic campaign shot by Brigitte Niedermair referencing key Surrealist motifs like disembodied hands and eyes, while other brands like Valentino offered dreamlike images of gowns presented in gargantuan scale. Presently, too, brands including Victoria Beckham and Prada are selling shirts covered in free-floating lips, reminiscent of Man Ray\\'s multimedia images and Salvador DalÃ\\xad\\'s bejeweled 1949 lips brooch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ruby Lips\" ruby and cultured pearl brooch, designed by Salvador Dali. Credit: Artyom Geodakyan/TASS/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Spring-Summer 2021 shows in September Surrealism infiltrated a number of collections: most notably back at the house of Schiaparelli. In recent years the fashion house has drawn heavily on its heritage, reworking many of Elsa Schiaparelli\\'s key themes and garments for a contemporary audience. This season the current artistic director Daniel Roseberry\\'s own vision extended to shocking pink suits covered in ghostly white limbs, shirts painted with breasts, and gold jewellery in the shape of nails, noses, and bulbous teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFashion is so often said to be a reflection of the times. During this strange ongoing crisis, the industry\\'s response has been split. Many brands have had to decide whether this is a year to focus on the concrete or the fantastical, while also trying to figure out how to remain not just relevant but necessary in the world facing so many critical challenges. Under such circumstances, it\\'s not surprising to see so many embrace Surrealism\\'s fractured approach to reality. It\\'s not just high-end designers either. Right now plenty of retailers are also selling clothes where the sleeves are big, the patterns bold, and the details unusual.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Salvador DalÃ\\xad once claimed, \"I try to create fantastical things, magical things, things like in a dream.\" Right now, perhaps such a statement speaks to our collective mood: one in which we are navigating a new and often unpredictable era, looking not just for straightforward escapism but, much like a dream, new ways of interpreting the everyday too.',\n",
       " 'Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no end to the global pandemic in sight, fashion and sportswear brands have been quickly adapting their lines to include face masks decorated with logos and stylish patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile cloth masks made of traditional materials can help slow the spread of Covid-19 , according to the World Health Organization, some labels are going one step further. They\\'re marketing new accessories, and in some cases entire clothing lines, as having antimicrobial properties -- applications that inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, or reduce viral activity. But what does antimicrobial fashion do, and can it provide extra protection during a pandemic\\r\\n\\r\\nBurberry announced an upcoming line of antimicrobial masks in their signature check textile. Credit: Courtesy Burberry\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent months, brands including Burberry have introduced masks that, they claim, are protected from microbes and germs. Burberry\\'s forthcoming beige and blue designs come in the label\\'s signature check. Under Armour\\'s multi-layered UA Sportsmask, which is â\\x80\\x8bmarketed as having antimicrobial properties, sold out in under an hour when it was released this summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Diesel is selling denim that it claims is \"virus-fighting.\" The Italian brand announced that it will use a technology called ViralOff -- which it says \"physically halts 99% of any viral activity\" -- in a number of items in its Spring-Summer 2021 collection. ViralOff works \"by interacting with key proteins, inhibiting the virus from attaching to textile fibers,\" reads Diesel\\'s press release.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, brands cannot claim that products will protect wearers from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, without providing sufficient evidence. â\\x80\\x8bTherefore, some labels simply allude to extra protection or hygiene, though the small print often reveals that antimicrobial treatments are only intended to inhibit bacterial or viral growth, not protect the user from pathogens. (Washing garments with soap once a day, as recommended by the World Health Organization , or WHO, can also kill bacteria and viruses.) The FDA and CDC â\\x80\\x8bdid not immediately respond to CNN\\'s requests for information regarding products that have been tested â\\x80\\x8bor submitted for formal approval.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout sound scientific testing by brands across the board, it is difficult to assess whether antimicrobial treatments can protect wearers from the novel coronavirus, according to Amy Price, a senior research scientist at Stanford Anesthesia Informatics and Media (AIM) Lab who has advised the WHO on its face mask guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The challenge is that sometimes claims are made, but they aren\\'t tested on the actual masks or with the actual virus,\" she said over a video conference call. \"So they\\'re like gimmicks.\" â\\x80\\x8bPrice has not tested any of the products mentioned in this article.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome companies say they have tested their products with SARS-CoV-2, like IFTNA\\'s PROTX2 AV that Under Armour says it uses, and HeiQ\\'s Viroblock , which, according to the company\\'s website, is used by numerous brands to produce reusable face masks, coats and even mattresses . IFTNA says recent lab testing \"shows PROTX2 AV\\'s efficacy against Covid-19,\" while HeiQ claims that Viroblock, which is added to the fabric during the final stage of the textile manufacturing process, has been \"tested effective against Sars-CoV-2.\" CNN has not been able to independently verify these claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut some â\\x80\\x8bothers have not revealed which viruses, if any, their products have been tested on, muddying the waters of so-called \"antimicrobial\" fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrice, who studied the effectiveness of fabric masks alongside AIM Lab\\'s director, Larry Chu, said there are a number of variables that determine how much protection a product offers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oftentimes, bacteria and viruses have different ways of reproducing, and different things are effective against them,\" she explained. \"With antimicrobial (treatments) it\\'s important to know what you\\'re dealing with, what it\\'s been tested with and if it\\'s safe for human skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(With) anything that you put on your face -- especially that you\\'re going to be wearing day in and day out -- you want to make sure it is really something that is safe or FDA approved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMurky claims\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the coronavirus outbreak was labeled a pandemic by the WHO in March, the guidance around mask-wearing has continued to evolve. Many countries now require face coverings to be worn in public spaces in order to reduce the spread of the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'re wearing (a mask) and the people around you are wearing it, we\\'ve seen that transmission (of the coronavirus) probably drops in the 90% plus range, which is pretty good odds,\" Dr. Atul Grover, executive director of the Association of American Medical Colleges Research and Action Institute, told CNN in August.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their study, Price and Chu found that cloth masks can \"do better than surgical masks in terms of blocking particles,\" Price said -- but only \"if they\\'re made well,\" with a triple-layered and tight-fitting design. (The WHO has produced a series of videos on recommended materials and fit, based on the pair\\'s research.)\\r\\n\\r\\nCloth face masks have become a popular reusable option during the pandemic. The World Health Organization recommends washing with soap and water in between wears to kill germs.

And there is no single type of technology being used by clothing brands, so each would require extensive individual studies to judge their efficacy. It will be important to consider whether a treated fabric is able to neutralize the virus, and if so, how long it takes (\"the virus can get in within nanoseconds,\" Price said), as well as the number of washes the antimicrobial treatment can withstand. â\\x80\\x8b\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this month, Polygiene, which recently partnered with Diesel and is the maker of ViralOff, said in a press release that the antimicrobial textile treatment technology can successfully kill 99% of SARS-CoV-2 from textile surfaces within two hours. While Price has not tested Polygiene\\'s ViralOff technology, she believes two hours is \"a lengthy disinfection time,\" explaining that the garment could contaminate skin, food, water or mucous membranes during that period if it makes contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolygiene describes its textile treatment as \"durable,\" but advises users to \"wash less and only when needed.\" Over email, the company clarified that it cannot guarantee ViralOff will continue to work after machine washing -- it recommends gently washing garments treated ViralOff by hand or not washing at all -- but said that another formula is currently in development.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Armour and Diesel did not return CNN\\'s requests for comment, while Burberry would not elaborate on the type of antimicrobial treatment used in its masks.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnresolved questions\\r\\n\\r\\nAs companies race to appeal to anxious consumers, â\\x80\\x8bclaims about antimicrobial garments\\' effectiveness against the novel coronavirus itself appears to be expanding. HeiQ claims that its aforementioned treatment technology kills 99.99% of the virus within 30 minutes, while fabric maker IFTNA claims that their product neutralizes over 99% of the virus in as little as 10 minutes thanks to its \"residual killing power.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth companies say their products have also been tested with other pathogens, including strains of influenza and different types of coronavirus, with each lasting 30 washes, but CNN is unable to independently verify these claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated video: 5 ways you can change your fashion habits to help the planet\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the companies vary in how they describe the protection offered by their products. Giancarlo Beevis, president of IFTNA, said over email: \"It will protect the wearer from potential transmission points on anything treated with PROTX2 AV.\" HeiQ, on the other hand, does not claim that its product can protect people against pathogens -- a legal disclaimer on its website says the treatment is meant to protect the textile itself, not the wearer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Antiviral fabrics reduce the risk of virus transmission through surface contamination and are added protection from the virus,\" said Rahel KÃ¤gi Romero, of HeiQ\\'s marketing team, over email. \"HeiQ does not want to make health claims and give people a wrong sense of security. Antiviral fabric is one factor in keeping people safe, but it needs to go hand in hand with other measures, such as keeping a social distance, wearing face masks when in crowded areas and washing hands regularly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile keeping your clothing virus-free could, potentially, reduce the chance of cross-contamination, there is still much that is unknown about SARS-CoV-2. The primary routes of transmission are still contested , as is the amount of the virus required to make a person ill. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), although the possibility hasn\\'t been ruled out, \"touching a surface or object that has the virus on it... isn\\'t thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possible benefits of antimicrobial fabrics are even less clear for garments that don\\'t usually come into contact with the face, like jeans, Price said. \"Unless you\\'re going to just be sitting there, rubbing your legs and then rubbing your face, then what\\'s the point?\" she asked. Plus, even if a textile treatment is proven to reduce certain viral activity, that doesn\\'t necessarily make it practical for all types of garments.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrice doesn\\'t discount the potential value of antimicrobial textiles, but so far, she said, the studies offer an incomplete picture. \"Should this be tested? Yes,\" she said. \"(But) it should absolutely not be marketed to the public through press releases and industry brochures before the results are vetted and replicated in a fair test of treatments, like a well-run randomized clinical trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even FDA trials contain three phases and aftermarket surveillance... If a person feels safer wearing a microbial textile, and this safety is only a marketing illusion, it could cost them their lives or their health.\"',\n",

The water is \"very thick ... like tar,\" and during the winter -- when monsoon rain no longer dilutes the wastewater -- \"you can smell it,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne 55-year-old, who has lived in Savar for the past 18 years and didn\\'t want to be identified for fear of reprisals, said the polluted waterways are a risk to his family\\'s health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The kids get sick if they stay here,\" he said, adding that his two children and grandson are unable to live with him \"because of the water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCost of color\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fashion industry uses around 93 billion cubic meters (21 trillion gallons) of water annually, enough to fill 37 million Olympic swimming pools, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Along with finishing, dyeing is the most polluting and energy-intensive processes involved in making our clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinishing is when chemicals or treatments are applied to fabric to give it the desired look or feel -- such as bleaching, softening or making the garment water resistant or anti-wrinkle. Large amounts of water and chemicals are also used during dyeing, to ensure vivid colors bind to the fabric and don\\'t fade or wash out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake denim as an example.\\r\\n\\r\\nA denim dyeing plant in Karachi, Pakistan shows spools of cotton before they are colored blue. Credit: Asim Hafeez/Bloomberg/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nProducing a single pair of jeans consumes around 7,500 liters (2,000 gallons) of water, from growing raw cotton to finished product, according to the United Nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure its blue color, the thread or fabric is repeatedly dunked in huge vats of synthetic indigo dye. After dyeing, the denim is treated and washed with more chemicals to soften or texture it. Getting the faded or \"worn in\" look requires even more chemical bathing, which uses acids, enzymes, bleach and formaldehyde.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut jeans aren\\'t the only polluters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every season we know that the fashion industry needs to highlight new colors,\" said Ma Jun, one of China\\'s leading environmentalists, in a phone interview. But, he added, \"each time you have a new color you\\'re going to use more, new kinds of chemicals and dye stuffs and pigments and catalysts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce they\\'re done, the cheapest way for factories to get rid of unusable, chemical-laden wastewater is to dump it into nearby rivers and lakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all of the chemicals and solvents used are hazardous, though the World Bank has identified 72 toxic ones that stem solely from textile dyeing. Once in waterways, they accumulate to the point where light is prevented from penetrating the surface, reducing plants\\' ability to photosynthesize. This lowers oxygen levels in the water, killing aquatic plants and animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso among them are chemicals and heavy metals that can build up in the body, increasing the risk of various cancers, acute illnesses and skin problems. Others have been found to increase in toxicity as they work their way up the food chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical-laden water is also used to irrigate crops, with one recent study finding that textile dyes were present in vegetables and fruit grown around Savar.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in the wastewater, dyeing chemicals are difficult to remove, said Sarah Obser, head of sustainability at PFI Hong Kong, a company that provides environmental and factory audits in Asia. \"The substances don\\'t degrade so they remain in the environment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1 / 9 Artisans lie fabrics on the ground to dry after undergoing a synthetic indigo dye process in Bagru village, near India\\'s Jaipur in December 2019.

They are commonly used in garment manufacturing and produce bold colors like bright reds or yellows.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut some azo dyes under certain conditions break down and release aromatic amines, a type of chemical compound (also used in pesticides and pharmaceuticals) that can increase the risk of cancer. These are so toxic that the European Union, China, Japan, India and Vietnam have all banned their use and import.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman impact\\r\\n\\r\\nWater pollution from the textile industry is a huge problem across garment-producing countries, most of which are found in Asia due to its huge pool of cheap labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen environmentalist Ma founded the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) over a decade ago, many rivers and lakes in China -- the world\\'s largest clothes manufacturer -- were so polluted that they were effectively dead, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nJian River in Luoyang, in north China\\'s Henan province, turned red from red dye that was dumped into the city\\'s storm water pipe network in December 2011. Credit: STR/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2006, his NGO has developed pollution databases to monitor companies\\' environmental performance, tested water sources and color-coded rivers and lakes according to how polluted they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In regions with concentrations of these dyes, we have seen some of the lakes in China contaminated to (such) a level that they are no longer good for use,\" said Ma.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers and people living close to factories often bear the brunt of the pollution. According to Ma, fishermen living near dye houses and textile mills along the tributaries of the Qiantang River have seen their catches shrink. \"They have lost their livelihoods because of it,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bangladesh, the Savar resident who did not want to be named said he doesn\\'t go into the water around his neighborhood anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This water causes sores on the body,\" he said, adding that people washing their hands or faces in the water have experienced fevers and skin irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack water runs through the manufacturing district of Savar, in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka.

They are hopeless, they don\\'t have money to install a filter or drill (for) deep water,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGastrointestinal problems and skin diseases are among the common ailments that he attributes directly to textile pollution.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN has reached out to Bangladesh\\'s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Directorate of General Health Services, and Dhaka health officials for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers in a dyeing factory in the Bangaldesh capital Dhaka in February 2016. Credit: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/NurPhoto/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chemicals used to dye clothes also impact garment workers who, in some factories, don\\'t have adequate protective clothing and may inhale toxic fumes. In Dhaka, experts say there are a growing number of factories that comply with international standards on chemical use and management, but there are still many smaller or subcontracted factories where conditions continue to fall short.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People don\\'t have gloves or sandals, they\\'re barefoot, they don\\'t have masks, and they are working with dangerous chemicals or dyes in a congested area. They are like sweat factories,\" Haque said, from firsthand accounts that he\\'s heard while working within communities tied to factories.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut because the textile industry is hugely important to Bangladesh\\'s economy, accounting for 20% of its GDP and employing about 4 million people, residents like Abdus Salam don\\'t want to see factories shuttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many of our people are working in these factories,\" he said. \"If they close these factories, the workers will become jobless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShift in attitudes\\r\\n\\r\\nBut change is happening. In Bangladesh, there are signs textile producers are taking environmental responsibility more seriously, with brands committing to initiatives, such as the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), that tackle water, energy and chemical use in the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd some Bangladeshi factories have environmental \"best practices and are developing their own connections\" with suppliers, said PFI Hong Kong\\'s Obser. But \"it remains a challenge to fully eliminate those smaller non-compliant ones because the fashion industry is very intransparent and price focused,\" she added, saying many companies do not have the training, knowledge or the funds to treat wastewater discharge or invest in new waterless or environmentally-friendly technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBangladesh\\'s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said it has made it mandatory for all polluting facilities to install effluent treatment plants and operate them \"optimally.\" And under a new environmental policy called Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), textile dyeing, finishing and washing industries \"must submit a time-bound plan to reduce, recycle and reuse the wastewater,\" Uddin said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is definitely room for further improvement,\" though rapid urbanization, high economic growth and industrialization all exacerbate the country\\'s environmental problems. \"These challenges cannot be eliminated overnight,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther countries have also been taking steps. In China, a range of tough new environmental policies have been enacted in the past few years, including a 2017 crackdown on textile and other polluting factories that saw the temporary closure of thousands that were found to be flouting environmental laws. In 2018, the Chinese government introduced a new environment protection tax aimed at cutting polluting discharge, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\\r\\n\\r\\nMa said factories and dye houses are increasingly being moved into industrial zones with centralized wastewater treatment plants, or being threatened with fines and closure if they don\\'t comply with regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults have been \"dramatic,\" with many of the dead, black rivers he once saw coming back to life.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man works in a fabric dye factory in Hangzhou in east China\\'s Zhejiang province in January 2020. Credit: Feature China/Barcroft Media/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nrecent study found that such efforts have improved water quality in some regions but toxic and polluted water still persists in parts of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fashion industry as a whole has undergone what Greenpeace East Asia\\'s Toxics Campaign Manager Ada Kong describes as \"a paradigm shift\" in its awareness of how chemicals are impacting the environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreenpeace\\'s ongoing \"Detox My Fashion\" campaign that aims to eliminate hazardous chemicals from the fashion industry has, since 2011, seen big brands like H&M, Adidas and Levi\\'s committing to identifying suppliers and implementing tougher environmental regulations and chemical management in their factories and supply chains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has also been a push for innovation in finding alternative chemicals and new technologies leading to the development of more environmentally-friendly dyes\\r\\n\\r\\nMountain to climb\\r\\n\\r\\nMany problems remain, however. For instance, China\\'s centralized treatment plants sometimes can\\'t cope with the volume of wastewater produced in its new industrial parks. And existing factories, saddled with costly treatment processes, often build secret discharge pipes or release their wastewater at night to avoid detection, Ma said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN has reached out to China\\'s Ministry of Ecology and Environment for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also remains incredibly hard for consumers to navigate the complex web of supply chains the fashion industry is built on, even if they try to shop ethically . Often, fashion brands don\\'t own their own factories so \"their relationships are not stable,\" with their many suppliers, said Kong.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They may only work with that supplier for two months, or shorter, for a batch of goods and then shift to another one. This is not good for auditing or ensuring the suppliers are responsible for the environment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while strides towards traceability and accountability have been made, there are still many brands and manufacturers not taking sustainability seriously, experts say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The mission has not yet been accomplished,\" said Ma.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarees and other garments are woven, bleached then dyed before being printed in the town of Pali, India, before being distributed all over the subcontinent. Credit: Jeremy Horner/LightRocket/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nSome experts believe the drive needs to come from big brands, which can encourage factories to build water treatment plants or invest in chemical-free technologies by committing to long-term contracts, even if costs rise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(What we\\'re) asking for is that brands build a strong and long-lasting relationship with their suppliers, so they can have more say in their environmental performance,\" said Kong.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, ridding the fashion industry of hazardous chemicals is likely to become even more challenging as our clothing addiction increases. Apparel consumption is set to rise by 63% to 102 million tons a year in 2030, according to a 2017 Pulse of the Fashion report.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the volume we are consuming, I don\\'t think there is a solution or best scenario without reducing the volume of our consumption,\" Kong said. \"Even if all of us dress in organic cotton and natural dyes it would still be devastating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bangladesh, those living along Savar\\'s black, contaminated rivers say they still feel helpless to stop the factories from polluting. Many fear repercussions from factory owners who often hold significant influence or political sway.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrustration appears to be building nonetheless. And if authorities don\\'t take further measures to clean up the water, Savar resident Abdus Salam said, then \"the future of this area will be full of darkness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional reporting by Morshed Alam Chanchal.',\n",
       " 'Written by Fiona Sinclair Scott London\\r\\n\\r\\nFashion is a creative dance between practical design and conceptual thinking. Success comes when the dance is so enthralling people can\\'t look away.\\r\\n\\r\\nJonathan Anderson understands this well and, as a result, he\\'s enjoyed high praise from critics and a loyal fanbase over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nActing as the creative head of two brands -- Spanish house Loewe and his own London-based label JW Anderson -- the Northern Irish designer has defined his creative pursuits through collaboration and curation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am an enabler. I am in a privileged position to shine a light on what other people do,\" he says of his role as creative director during an interview at JW Anderson\\'s headquarters in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch now: Inside the mind of Jonathan Anderson, fashion\\'s creative polymath\\r\\n\\r\\nUnveiling JW Anderson\\'s most recent collection without a traditional runway show, due to the ongoing pandemic, he instead sent would-be guests an interactive booklet featuring photographs of models in various new looks that could be cut out and played with. It was crafty, low-fi and a reminder that fashion is ultimately about making things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnderson is a collector of objects, and is passionate about supporting craftspeople and makers through exhibitions and initiatives like the Loewe Craft Prize (\"craft is the one of the bedrocks of creativity,\" he says). He is also a creative polymath who happily moves between high-brow and mainstream influences, with references soaring and diving between art history and pop culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \"Disobedient Bodies,\" a 2017 exhibition he curated at the Barbara Hepworth museum in Wakefield, England, Anderson brought together high art and fashion: Figurative sculptures by Henry Moore and Louise Bourgeois stood alongside fashion from the archives of Jean Paul Gaultier and Rei Kawakubo. He said, at the time, that there was \"an excitement about the dialogue of these two characters speaking to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnderson has collaborated with a number of brands in recent years, from the accessible Topshop, Uniqlo and Converse to the luxury house of Versace. All of which begs the obvious question: How does he manage to keep so many projects straight in his head?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe admits to having a low threshold for boredom and thriving under pressure. He describes his creative of web of influences as a mind map -- the kind he worked with at school as a child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For me, it\\'s all about mind-mapping. I sit at the center of it as an \\'eye,\\' as the curator of it, and (radiating outwards) from that are satellite projects: There is Loewe, there is Moncler, there is JW Anderson, there\\'s Uniqlo,\" he says. \"There are collaborations with artists, or there could be a museum retrospective... They all represent different things to me (and they) get me out of bed in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf these satellites, Moncler is his newest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJW Anderson for Moncler Genius Credit: Tyler Mitchell\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the banner of \"one house, different voices,\" the Moncler Genius project , which first launched during Milan Fashion Week in February 2018, has tossed aside the idea of appointing a single creative director to helm a fashion label. Instead, the Italian brand invites different creative directors to create individual collections that are released on a rolling calendar throughout the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its launch, a number of high-profile designers have taken part, including Valentino\\'s Pierpaolo Piccioli, who designed two collections for the label before moving on. And the project\\'s large-scale, immersive showcases, which exhibit the designers\\' collections in unique environments during Milan Fashion Week, have produced the very hype the label\\'s CEO Remo Ruffini had hoped for.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuffini is up front about this strategy: \"The key objective of Genius wasn\\'t to sell, but to create buzz around the brand, to surprise and to tell more about Moncler\\'s different angles while also attracting new generations,\" he said via email.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnderson\\'s collection for Moncler Genius took pride of place in Milan amid the hubbub of last February\\'s fashion week. Fast-forward to October and the pieces are now available to buy. In a perfectly choreographed move, a series of images shot by one of today\\'s most sought-after photographers, Tyler Mitchell , were released online alongside the clothing drop. The playful, otherworldly photos generated further attention on Instagram -- and more of the buzz Moncler is after.\\r\\n\\r\\nJonathan Anderson\\'s showcase in Milan for Moncler Genius Credit: Courtesy Moncler/Cris Fragkou\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the collection of puffed jackets, shorts and accessories, dedicated fans of Anderson\\'s will see tributes to past his past work. This, he said, was entirely by design, calling it his \"\\'inflated archive.\" A pair of ruffled shorts, for example, are an inflated version of the design he presented in JW Anderson\\'s Autumn-Winter 2014 collection (albeit this time with the incorporation of dinosaur-like three-dimensional spikes).\\r\\n\\r\\nTreating his Moncler collection as, in essence, a small retrospective might help onlookers struggling to see a reason, or imagine a buyer, for such outlandish designs. Collectors of fashion -- and his most dedicated and wealthy fans -- will no doubt invest in the pieces, which range from a Â£220 ($280) T-shirt to the designer\\'s Â£2,390 ($3,000) interpretation of a black puffer jacket.\\r\\n\\r\\nA look from the new collection by Jonathan Anderson for Moncler Genius.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoncler will, of course, benefit from the attention, but collaborations like this also help Anderson diversify his revenue streams and extend the reach of his own personal brand. Such an approach is, in this day and age, strategically important. Consumers want deeper connections with the people behind the brands they lend their loyalty to.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut despite his ever-growing sphere of creative influence, Anderson hasn\\'t lost sight of the philosophy at center of his mind map: that \"the making is what\\'s important -- the brand comes second.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReflecting on the time that\\'s passed since February he adds, \"I hope we have become more humble, that we actually want to hear the stories of craftspeople.\"',\n",

And then there were the 3,000 well-wishers who broke through police barricades to witness Jacqueline Lee Bouvier\\'s arrival at her wedding to then Sen. John Fitzgerald Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA photo of the newlyweds ran on the front page of The New York Times on September 13, 1953. But the grainy black-and-white shot, the bride half obscured by her husband, couldn\\'t do justice to the bouffant skirt and the layers of silk taffeta, the intricate scallop pintucks and tiny flowers of wax -- a fitting choice for the woman who would go on to become American royalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gown, like those worn by Kennedy\\'s bridesmaids, was the work of African American designer Ann Lowe, who died in February 1981.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That dress she made for Jackie Kennedy was widely photographed. A lot of people saw it and it no doubt influenced average American wedding dresses and ball gowns,\" said Elizabeth Way, an assistant curator at The Museum at FIT. \"The fact that (the dress) came from the creativity of a Black woman really speaks to how instrumental Black people have been in shaping American culture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackie and John Kennedy are shown in their wedding attire.

According to fashion historian Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell, who is the author of the recently released book \"The Way We Wed: A Global History of Wedding Fashion,\" Kennedy was no fan of the dress she wore to walk down the aisle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even though it\\'s a beautiful dress, it was not what she wanted, and she actually compared it to a lampshade,\" Chrisman-Campbell explained. \"It was chosen by her father-in-law-to-be, who wanted to create an American royalty moment and really set up his son as the heir to the family dynasty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis bridal portrait of Jackie Kennedy captures the finery of her Ann Lowe-designed wedding dress. Credit: Bachrach/Archive Photos/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that point, Lowe was an established arbiter of American high-society style, delighting wealthy clients across the country (including Jaqueline\\'s mother, Janet Lee Auchincloss, who commissioned Lowe to create her daughter\\'s debutante and wedding dresses) with made-to-order princess silhouettes and couture-level embellishments. Years later, The Saturday Evening Post described her as \"society\\'s best kept secret\" and \"unfamiliar except to the very rich.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn unrepentant snob, Lowe was selective about her clients. Only the most elite were deserving of her efforts -- the Rockefellers and the du Ponts of the world, as well as stars like Olivia de Havilland, who wore one of Lowe\\'s hand-painted floral designs the night she won best actress at the 1947 Academy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love my clothes and I\\'m particular about who wears them,\" Lowe said in an interview with Ebony magazine. \"I\\'m not interested in sewing for cafe society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for the families of the Social Register.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo cater to her clientele, there was seemingly nothing she wouldn\\'t do. After a flood in her Manhattan studio destroyed the Kennedy dresses just 10 days before the ceremony, she and her team worked day and night to ensure a new set was completed on time.

She later studied design in New York, segregated from her White peers (she graduated after only six months because of her exceptional abilities) before setting up shop in Florida, where she built her reputation for extravagance and exclusivity. After a decade, she returned to Manhattan to do the same on the East Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the extreme wealth of the clients she so cherished wasn\\'t enough to buoy her business. They would routinely talk her into lowering her prices, and she would often end up losing money from commissions. In 1963, she declared bankruptcy.

       " 'Written by Brian Boucher, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years of resisting calls for its removal, New York\\'s American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) has asked the city to dislodge from its front steps an equestrian monument to Theodore Roosevelt, the twenty-sixth US president, which depicts him charging forward, and towering over two mostly nude figures, one Black and one Indigenous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement dated June 2020 sent to museum staff, posted on the museum\\'s website, Ellen Futter, president of the institution\\'s board, said, \"As we strive to advance our institution\\'s, our City\\'s, and our country\\'s passionate quest for racial justice, we believe that removing the statue will be a symbol of progress and of our commitment to build and sustain an inclusive and equitable Museum community and broader society.\" (After the announcement President Donald Trump tweeted, \"Ridiculous, don\\'t do it!\")\\r\\n\\r\\nMight this concession be a harbinger of other changes ahead for American museums? How can institutions whose leadership is often overwhelmingly White rethink their staffing, collections and exhibitions, much less move toward more truly equitable governance? Or, some ask, should museums continue to exist in anything like their current form?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe controversial statue of former President Theodore Roosevelt outside of the Museum of Natural History, featuring a Black man and a Indigenous man at his sides Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Natural History Museum\\'s statement places the monument\\'s removal in the context of \"the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd,\" a Black man who was killed by four police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, one of whom knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. After a video of Floyd\\'s killing went viral, tens of thousands took to the streets in protest in the US and around the world, even in the midst of a pandemic, to demand accountability for police brutality and to call for the defunding, or even the abolition of local police forces, among other demands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of an Indigenous figure in the Roosevelt monument, and the museum itself, have a very personal meaning for Wendy Red Star, an artist and member of the Crow tribe. She created a project, \"The 1880 Crow Peace Delegation,\" about a group of Crow chiefs who traveled to Washington, DC, that year to try to negotiate a peace treaty. In researching for the project, she found that the remains of one of those chiefs, Pretty Eagle, had been stolen from a burial site and later sold to the AMNH. The tribe was able to repatriate the remains in the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t until I did this project that I learned about that,\" Red Star said in a phone interview. \"The Roosevelt monument was the first thing I thought of. To me, it\\'s a really direct connection to how my people have been presented at the museum -- along with the dinosaur bones as part of the natural world. It\\'s always been such a surreal experience to see my community\\'s objects on display and watch people observing them as if these were peoples of the past.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as government, law enforcement, and all forms of authority are being questioned in this moment of upheaval, museums worldwide have come in for intense scrutiny, and the situation on the ground is changing very fast. Earlier this month, dozens of current and former staffers of multiple cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art as well as institutions nationwide, published an open letter accusing the institutions of unfair treatment of employees of color and saying that \"your covert and overt white supremacy that has benefited the institution, through the unrecognized dedication and hard labor of Black/Brown employees, with the expectation that we remain complacent with the status quo, is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nApsÃ¡alooke Feminist #4, 2016, by Wendy Red Star Credit: Courtesy Wendy Red Star\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin days, staffers at the Guggenheim and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art openly accused the institutions\\' leadership of racism. In an emailed statement to CNN, Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation, said the institution was prepared to address these concerns:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a society, we are confronting sustained injustices never resolved, and feel today the pain and anger of previous moments of turmoil. The Guggenheim addresses the shared need of great reform, and long overdue equality, and want to reaffirm that we are dedicated to doing our part.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In this period of self-reflection and reckoning, we will engage in dialogue with our staff and review all processes and procedures to lead to positive change,\" he continued. \"We are expediting our ongoing ... efforts to produce an action plan for demonstrable progress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Metropolitan Museum declined to comment. The Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art did not respond to requests for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuseums have also been critiqued for issuing anodyne statements that failed to mention Floyd or the Black Lives Matter movement. The Getty Museum, in Los Angeles, posted an unspecific call for \"equity and fairness\" on Instagram, and later apologized ; the director of New York\\'s Metropolitan Museum of Art privately apologized to Black artist Glenn Ligon for using a work of his from the museum\\'s holdings on social media without his permission, according to the New York Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecolonize This Place protesting outside the American Museum of Natural History Credit: Andres Rodriguez/Decolonize This Place\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AMNH\\'s statement does not mention the groups that have for several years organized protests calling for the Roosevelt monument\\'s removal. In a phone interview, Decolonize This Place (DTP) organizer Amin Husain pointed out that removal of the monument was just one of three demands that Decolonize had placed on the museum, which include internally renaming Columbus Day as Indigenous People\\'s Day and rethinking the museum\\'s displays.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many of the museum\\'s galleries contain Indigenous remains and objects,\" he said. \"Those things need to be sent back to the people they were taken from, and the exhibitions must be completely overhauled in consultation with, and with the active participation of, the relevant stakeholders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many U.S. museums have made moves toward what the field calls \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" fellow DTP organizer Marz Saffore called for much greater change. \"It\\'s critical that we move past identity politics,\" she said. \"It\\'s not enough to hire an Indigenous curator. It\\'s not enough to have one Black person on your board. Museums as we know them have to be abolished. I don\\'t want my voice to be added to museums that are often trophy cases for Imperialism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstitutions like the AMNH will continue to be sites for debate, some of which may echo heated arguments among historians and activists on how to handle monuments to objectionable historical figures. This includes leaders of the Confederate Army in the US Civil War, which were erected by Confederate sympathizers oftentimes decades after the war, with a conscious white supremacist purpose\\r\\n\\r\\nSome ask whether these monuments could, rather than being destroyed or removed, be altered by, for example, adding contextualizing information. In an interview with National Public Radio on Tuesday about the Roosevelt monument, historian Manisha Sinha suggested that this tribute to Roosevelt\\'s efforts toward nature conservation could still stand, if the subjugated Black and Indigenous figures were simply removed. (DTP pointed out in an emailed statement that the land Roosevelt \"conserved\" was stolen from Indigenous people, so they would hardly find that an acceptable solution.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, Abraham Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, former public affairs czar for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and author of books including \"Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion\" (2014), wrote an editorial this month for the New York Daily News saying that while he had earlier asked whether Confederate monuments could be altered, he\\'d concluded that they must be removed. \"I was not only wrong,\" he wrote; \"I was insensitive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Diaz-Griffith, executive director of the Sir John Soane\\'s Museum Foundation, has written a pamphlet on how to be an anti-racist preservationist Credit: Michael Diaz Griffith\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Diaz-Griffith, executive director of the New York-based Sir John Soane\\'s Museum Foundation, which supports the Soane Museum in London, is author of \"The Anti-Racist Preservationist\\'s Guide to Confederate Monuments: Their Past and a Future Without Them,\" a pamphlet that succinctly explains how such monuments have a foundation in white supremacy, and outlines why they should be struck from the public realm. \"In the case of the Confederates there\\'s no public legacy to detach from their wrongdoing,\" Diaz-Griffith said over the phone.\"The Confederacy was an immoral enterprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDiaz-Griffith envisions a future, sooner or later, free of tributes to any such contentious figures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that all named buildings, all named places, will end up being reevaluated,\" he said. \"Who should they be named after? Do we continue to focus on those who were recognized in their own times, or do we shift our attention to those who fought for justice but weren\\'t publicly honored when they were alive? Since all people are fallible, it may be a good idea to erect monuments to principles, like justice, rather than to individuals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUS museums, dependent as they are on the largesse of wealthy individuals and families, are far from a future in which controversial donors, who, for instance, hold views that run counter to science, nonetheless have galleries or other features named for them. The AMNH itself was under scrutiny for taking money from Rebekah Mercer, a major donor to the Republican party, whose leader Donald Trump has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change during his time in office. Mercer left the board when her term ended in 2019. Meanwhile in 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named the revamped plaza on Fifth Avenue for donor David H. Koch, likewise a Republican donor, who is notable for funding efforts to undercut climate change science.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the activists who had called for the removal of the Roosevelt monument have more foundational questions in mind than who funds such cultural organizations. Representing the group NYC Stands with Standing Rock, Sandy Grande, using the Lenape people\\'s name for Manhattan, said in a phone interview, \"We should underscore that the city (Mannahatta) wouldn\\'t exist without the land and labor of Black and Indigenous peoples. This is Lenape land and the Mohawk and Seneca peoples built much of the city. In addition to Black people\\'s labor, their settlement at Seneca Village was destroyed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So,\" she said, \"the removal of the monument has been a long time coming, not just for the museum but for the city itself, and we will continue to press for change.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMakeba Clay, the Phillips Collection\\'s first chief diversity officer Credit: Rhiannon Newman/Courtesy Makeba Clay\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an historic moment -- a pause and reflect moment for individuals and institutions,\" said Makeba Clay, the chief diversity officer at the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, over email. \"The systemic and unrelenting injustices against members of the Black community have existed for hundreds of years and continue to exist all around us, including in our museums. We know we have work to do and that means being actively anti-racist -- not passively non-racist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nClay was the inaugural appointee to her role, which she took on in 2018 and her message is that it\\'s not enough to \"amplify\" voices and messages, art institutions must take action. \"We are looking at our staff and board, both overwhelmingly white, and actively examining our hiring and recruitment processes to promote greater diversity,\" she said. \"We recently held a town hall, which uncovered stark differences between staff of color and white staff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nClay also said that art does not exist outside struggle. That while it can be used for \"constructive discourse, building empathy and creating community,\" art also \"can confront current issues and topics that aren\\'t neutral.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding: \"What appears like radical action is exactly what museums need to pursue to prove that they have a valuable role to play in this national discourse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTop image: Fall, from the series Four Seasons, 2006, by Wendy Red Star.',\n",
       " 'Written by Scott McLean, CNN Nadine Schmidt, CNN Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany\\r\\n\\r\\nPerched on a steep hilltop in southern Germany, the striking turrets of Hohenzollern Castle rise in contrast to the rolling countryside that surrounds them. The fortress is the ancestral seat of Germany\\'s last imperial family. If the country still had a monarchy today, the castle\\'s owners would be its royal family , led by Georg Friedrich, whose ceremonial title is also his legal surname: Prince of Prussia.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside, the would-be Kaiser Prince Georg cranes his neck towards an ornate family tree painted on the wall behind him. He proudly describes his lineage, which traces back through centuries of kings and queens who ruled over Prussia (a once-vast area that included parts of modern-day Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Russia and Denmark) through German monarchs like his great-great-grandfather, the Kaiser who led the country into World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, along with the castle and the wealth, Prince Georg has also inherited a very public and, at times, ugly legal battle with authorities to reclaim a family fortune confiscated after the fall of the Nazis. According to Prince Georg, the vast collection of more than 10,000 items includes everything from priceless artworks to the opulent heirlooms of German history\\'s most powerful and important family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case was first filed decades ago , but it has recently provoked ire and outrage among the German public, many of whom believe he\\'s entitled to nothing at all. And some historians are skeptical of his claims.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see it as my duty,\" he tells CNN, in his first ever TV interview on the subject. \"I think my family would fully agree to pursue these claims, whether the judges will eventually judge in our favor or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch now: Germany\\'s ex-royals want their riches back\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding between Prince Georg\\'s family and a cache of untold monetary and cultural value is a broadly worded German law that disqualifies those who helped the Nazis into power from restitution or compensation for lost property. To understand today\\'s legal wrangling, you have to go back more than a century into a grim chapter of German history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1918, following defeat in World War I, the country ditched its royal family to become a republic and a democracy. The then-Kaiser and his family gave up their power but got to keep a substantial part of the fortune they\\'d amassed over the centuries: castles, land, artworks, crowns, swords and jewels. The ex-royals then went into exile in the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War II, Germany was divided into west and east, with the communist Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic taking control of the latter and seizing the property of ordinary citizens and ex-royals alike. The vast majority of the then-privately-owned German royal fortune fell on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. It would take almost half a century for the Berlin Wall to come down.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after, in the 1990s, a reunified Germany passed a law allowing anyone whose property was expropriated to reclaim it. Millions of ordinary families that had fled East Germany used the legislation to reclaim their homes . But the law came with a very specific catch: Those who \"substantially supported\" the Nazis were ineligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis all means that a complex legal claim being debated in 2020 hinges, ultimately, on the actions of one man in the 1930s: Prince Georg\\'s great-grandfather (and the son of Germany\\'s last Kaiser, Wilhelm II), Crown Prince Wilhelm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result has the potential to shift large portions of museum collections from public to private hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A court decision brings with it the danger of a decision in favour of the House of Hohenzollern and, in the worst-case scenario, of the large-scale removal of objects from the collections of cultural institutions,\" a spokesperson for the German Ministry of Culture told CNN by email. \"An out-of-court settlement, by contrast, would likely make it possible to avoid lengthy court proceedings and would provide a viable foundation for cooperation between the House of Hohenzollern and the affected cultural institutions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked if Prince Georg\\'s claims are justified, a spokesperson for the Berlin Senate Department of Culture told CNN in an email, \"The political answer is no. From a legal point of view, things can look different. That is the only reason for the talks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd beyond the historical treasures at stake, the case ultimately gives rise to a question German society has long grappled with: how to judge the sins of your ancestors.\\r\\n\\r\\nA uncomfortable family photo\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Hohenzollern Castle, Prince Georg is shown a photo he\\'s seen before: It\\'s his great grandfather Crown Prince Wilhelm, in 1933, dressed in a military uniform and a Nazi armband. He\\'s standing above a large swastika at a rally of 80,000 members of the SA , a Nazi paramilitary group. By this time, Wilhelm had returned from exile on the condition that he wouldn\\'t involve himself in politics -- a promise he apparently couldn\\'t keep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s very hard to look at,\" Prince Georg says. \"These pictures are very strong. Especially when you see the swastika on his arm. It always makes your breath stop, and you ask yourself, \\'Why is he wearing that?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA photograph discovered by historian John Rohl shows Germany\\'s former Crown Prince Wilhelm saluting at an SA rally in October 1933. Credit: The Associated Press of Great Britain/John Rohl\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1930s, Communism was a rising force around the world and the Great Depression had plunged people into poverty, drawing many Germans towards Adolf Hitler\\'s nationalist agenda. Germany had been a fragile democracy for barely a decade when Hitler was elected Chancellor in 1933, the year Wilhelm was photographed in the Nazi armband. There are other photos like it, including one of the Crown Prince locked in a momentary gaze with a grinning Hitler.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Georg says his great-grandfather may have been wearing a swastika, but his primary motivation was to return the monarchy to power -- and he believed Hitler could make that happen. The Nazi leader may have even entertained the possibility. A British newspaper reported in 1932 that he was secretly plotting, upon his election, to tear up the newly-enshrined democratic constitution and form a government \"with the ex-Crown Prince at its head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Crown Prince was driven by the idea of getting back monarchy or getting back to the throne,\" Prince Georg says of his great-grandfather. \"But he was also misled by the idea that it might be a better to appease the Nazis, at least at the beginning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a disempowered former prince. He was not widely respected. He was a playboy. Chris Clark, historian\\r\\n\\r\\nIt soon became clear that Hitler had no plans to hand over power to anyone. The Daily Mirror reported the Crown Prince was \"disappointed at Hitler\\'s changed attitude towards the monarchy,\" though he continued publicly supporting him nonetheless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He thought that it might help to keep the (Nazis) in control and lead them (down a different path), which might be more fortunate for our country,\" Prince Georg said. \"And judging from now, this was a horrible misconception.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than enabling Hitler\\'s rise, Wilhelm and the ex-royal family was, according to Prince Georg\\'s reading, \"seen as a constant threat\" due to their ongoing popularity with some segments of the public. Proof of this, he says, can be seen in 1940, when tens of thousands of people took to Potsdam\\'s streets to mourn the death of the Crown Prince\\'s son. Or in 1944, when Hitler\\'s secretary recalled that, following a failed attempt on his life, Hitler said, \"believe me, it will come out that the real instigator is the Crown Prince!\" He wasn\\'t, and Hitler\\'s paranoia is well documented. But Hitler\\'s suspicion proves he saw the Crown Prince as a threat, not an ally, Prince Georg says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was in a very difficult position because...If he had shown more opposition -- which he is now blamed for not doing -- I have no idea whether I would be sitting here,\" he says, explaining that a distant uncle was sent to a concentration camp for doing just that.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, Prince Georg also argues that Wilhelm had neither the power nor the clout to prevent the dictator\\'s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time, the Crown Prince lacked the political influence to substantially contribute to the rise of the Nazi regime,\" said Prince Georg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the very position taken by Chris Clark, an historian at Cambridge University\\'s St Catharine\\'s College, in a 2011 research paper commissioned by Prince Georg\\'s family, the House of Hohenzollern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a disempowered former prince,\" Clark told CNN. \"He was not widely respected. He was a playboy... he liked the look of Hitler, he was quite sympathetic with the Nazi party, but he didn\\'t actually become a card-carrying Nazi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(Crown Prince Wilhelm\\'s) lack of political talent, his lack of a powerful network and his lack of an official position from which he could wield power meant that, as much as he might want to help Hitler, his help wasn\\'t especially effective.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former Crown Prince Wilhelm pictured with Hitler. Credit: Bundesarchiv, Bild/Georg Pahl\\r\\n\\r\\nThat didn\\'t stop the Crown Prince from trying. In a New York newspaper column published in 1933, Wilhelm praised Hitler\\'s \"clear-sighted and energetic leadership\" and blamed communists and Jews for Germany\\'s tattered reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his paper, Clark concluded that although the Crown Prince undoubtedly supported Hitler, his support wasn\\'t \"substantial.\" In other words, the Hohenzollerns ought to be entitled to compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvolving historical evidence\\r\\n\\r\\nPlenty of experts have disagreed with Clark -- hinting at the complexity of this longstanding legal battle. Now the Australian-British historian says he has changed his mind, citing newly-uncovered evidence showing that the Crown Prince had more public influence than originally thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what happens in history,\" he says. \"We find out new stuff, we change our mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new evidence was unearthed by Stephan Malinowski, a historian at the University of Edinburgh whose research has concluded that the Crown Prince significantly contributed to the Nazi regime. Malinowski, who declined to be interviewed for this story, is one of four historians commissioned by the government and Prince Georg\\'s family to investigate the relationship between Wilhelm and the Nazis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN interviewed five additional historians for this story, four of whom now side with Malinowski, though most also agreed that neither side\\'s case is iron-clad. Among them is John Rohl, who said that the Crown Prince had once bragged \"that he had actually transposed 2 million votes to Hitler,\" and Stephanie Middendorf, who argues that he helped make the Nazis more palatable to the upper-class elites he rubbed shoulders with.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are others who support Clark\\'s original position -- historians like Wolfram Pyta, whose 155-page research paper, also commissioned by the House of Hohenzollern, concluded that the Crown Prince \"actively rejected the Nazi system.\" Or, independent historian Benjamin Hasselhorn, who told CNN that the Crown Prince \"did provide support [to the Nazis] but not substantial support.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1994 compensation law effectively ensures that the German government isn\\'t forced to compensate industrial giants -- like Volkswagen and BMW -- who supported the Nazis\\' rise to power and relied on forced labor from concentration camps, to build cars during WWII. Both companies have acknowledged their historic responsibility and paid compensation to victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the law\\'s intent is unclear when it comes to former royals. In the 1800s, before Germany was a country, the region was comprised of many smaller kingdoms, each with their own royal, or noble, families. Some of them have already quietly secured restitution for property and land lost during communist rule in East Germany, like Michael-Benedikt Prince von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach, who in 2003 dropped his claims for restitution of art works, manuscripts and the inventory of the Wartburg Castle near Eisenach, in return for â\\x82¬15.5 million ($18.2 million).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1 / 19 The view towards Hohenzollern Castle from Hechingen.

Credit: Patrick Junker/Laif/Redux for CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nCultural collateral\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Prince Georg, the thousands of items on the line range from a simple coffee spoon to centuries-old works of art. Items that ended up outside Germany or were otherwise lost also form part of the negotiations, in case they eventually re-surface. His family is also seeking cash compensation of â\\x82¬1.2 million ($1.4 million), which represents the value of their land at the time it was seized.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Prince\\'s spokesperson, \"It is safe to assume that the current value of the family Ì\\x81s private property taken by the communists is several hundred times higher.\" Berlin state authorities meanwhile told CNN that the overall value of the Hohenzollerns\\' claim is \"high, but not quantifiable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no longer any property at stake, though the Prince recently settled his claim for the ancient Rheinfels Castle on the condition that the charity run by his wife receives a portion of ticket sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis debate really belongs in the public and it cannot, and should not, be suffocated by legal action. Eckart Conze, historian\\r\\n\\r\\nComplicating matters for the German government is the fact that Prince Georg is also the largest lender of art to cultural institutions in the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg (both facing legal claims along with the federal government) including the many paintings, furniture and other items on display at Charlottenburg Palace. He owns the crowns of the first Prussian King and Queen, which are displayed alongside an orb and scepter that he\\'s seeking to have returned. He also owns the jewel-encrusted tobacco boxes that once belonged to Frederick the Great, the longest serving Prussian King.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prince says he\\'s committed to keeping the disputed items on public display, regardless of whether they eventually change hands. \"I really strongly feel this cultural responsibility to contribute something to the country and to show these items to the public,\" he says. \"Actually, we are on the same side as the government.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe insists his claim is not about money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was that easy, I think my ancestors would have sold this place, the Castle Hohenzollern... and we would have sold our (remaining) art collection, which we lend to Berlin and to Brandenburg\" he said. \"It\\'s not as simple as just taking a check.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, by a painting of his ancestor Crown Prince Wilhelm. Credit: Patrick Junker/laif/laif/Patrick Junker/laif\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, he may face an uphill battle convincing a skeptical German public of his charitable motivations. And while the case has been quietly ongoing for decades, it has recently become a matter of public interest, thanks in part to Jan BÃ¶hmermann, host of a satirical program akin to \"The Daily Show.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the half-hour segment, the late-night comedian roasted Prince Georg for having the \"balls of steel\" to bring his demands to court. The comedian also dismissed his claims as outrageous and hypocritical, given that genocide victims in Germany\\'s former colonies under the royals\\' rule were never compensated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh-profile clashes\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Georg has also been criticized for his public handling of the case. His legal team has filed at least 30 warning letters and lawsuits, primarily targeting historians and journalists, since the case became public. Historian Eckart Conze says he was served with a lawsuit after criticizing the Prince for serving too many lawsuits. Specifically, he says the Prince\\'s lawyers took aim at his claims that the legal threats were an attempt to \"suffocate an important and necessary public debate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConze says he had a choice: refrain from making similar statements or prepare for a legal fight. The historian chose the latter and is awaiting his day in court, though many of his colleagues have kept quiet because they can\\'t afford to do the same, he says. A German non-profit called the Open Knowledge Foundation is currently crowdfunding for the legal defense of journalists and historians who say that they have been threatened by the Hohenzollerns\\' lawyers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This debate really belongs in the public and it cannot, and should not, be suffocated by legal action,\" Conze says.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Georg insists that he\\'s never sued over critical reporting, only false or defamatory statements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it is very important to have the freedom of the press, as it is part of our constitution. And it\\'s also a pillar of our democracy. But lying is not, and that was the only thing we tried to straighten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked if he regrets his public handling of the case, he says, \"We could have been better on that, yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNegotiating positions\\r\\n\\r\\nThe would-be Kaiser -- who is also 202nd in line to the British throne according to royalty expert Marlene Koenig -- says he hasn\\'t sought out attention, but the legal wrangling has made it impossible to avoid. When he first took over as head of the House of Hohenzollern at age 18, he initially wondered if he wanted the responsibility at all. But his grandfather asked him to continue the restitution case, he says, a promise that still motivates him today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I feel obliged to fulfill his last will because he also wrote very explicitly in his testament that he expects me to follow his footsteps,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extended interview with Prince Georg\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this case is, now, much bigger than Prince Georg or his grandfather. Beyond the moral question of how the legal system ought to judge the transgressions of the Crown Prince, it encourages a broader national discussion in a country that is still reconciling the past. Germany is, after all, still putting accused Nazi war criminals on trial 75 years after the end of the World War II. By asking whether Crown Prince Wilhelm facilitated the Nazis\\' rise, Prince Georg also thinks Germans ought to ask who else was responsible. What about the millions who voted for them? Or the big businesses who supported them?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is, Prince Georg says, a national debate that\\'s yet to be resolved.\" (Our claims) are not the reason for the discussion... I think we are kind of a symptom for the whole discussion -- or the discussion that needs to take place,\" he says, clearly hoping the historical debate won\\'t distract from Germany\\'s more recent legal traditions: to judge a case based on the law, not society\\'s evolving moral standards. \"I\\'m very happy that I live in a constitutional state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now, neither the prince nor the Brandenburg government appear willing to risk an all-or-nothing outcome by taking the case to court. Both sides recently agreed to delay court proceedings, which were due to begin in August, for another year to give them more time to reach a negotiated settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOscar Holland, Fiona Sinclair Scott, Claudia Otto, Stephanie Halasz, Anastasia Graham-Yooll, Lewis Whyld, Nathan Hodge, Brett Roegiers, Woojin Lee, Hena Sharma, Oscar Featherstone, Ingo Witte, Christian Streib, Martin Bourke and Philip Schneider Klar contributed to this story.',\n",
       " 'The city\\'s complex drainage system protects Hong Kong from once-disastrous flooding caused by seasonal typhoons. But will it be strong enough to withstand the effects of climate crisis?\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow the mountains that overlook Hong Kong\\'s financial district, drainage engineer Alex Lau is ankle-deep in water flowing into a giant tunnel almost twice the height of a double-decker bus.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of a ground-breaking, $3.8 billion (30 billion Hong Kong dollar) drainage network, this tunnel runs nearly the length of Hong Kong Island and has saved the city from floods that decades ago routinely cost lives and caused widespread destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This tunnel intercepts about one third of the rainfall for the northern Hong Kong area,\" Lau says, as he looks west to the point where the tunnel fades to black. \"We have about 34 intakes and all the intercepted water will be diverted into the tunnel and carried all the way to the sea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDug with two vast tunnel-boring machines over five years, beginning in 2007, the 10.5-kilometer-long (6.5 mile) tunnel, about half the length of Manhattan, has solved a basic but pressing problem facing one of Asia\\'s wettest cities: rain. Hong Kong receives about 2,400 millimeters it per year, according to the Drainage Services Department (DSD). And about 80% of that water falls in just a few months.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut building this network in one of the world\\'s densest cities wasn\\'t easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn entrance to the tunnel, located near the neighborhood of Tai Hang. Credit: Joshua Berlinger/CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nHong Kong Island was already criss-crossed by tunnels, carrying the city\\'s subway system and accommodating roads that slice through the mountainous landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, the Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel runs through the hills behind the city, tucked less than a dozen meters below the surface -- though few of the city\\'s residents, whose lives it protects each rainy season, ever realize it is there.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngineers had to shore up insecure ground above the tunnel to prevent water seeping through and causing parts of it to collapse. To tackle the difficulty of building tunnel intakes -- pipes and entrances leading to the main drain -- in dense urban areas, the decided to dig upwards from the tunnels and then extract gravel and debris that fell down out of the subterranean network to avoid causing too much disruption at street level.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequent flooding\\r\\n\\r\\nA true Hong Kong summer can be a test of any resident\\'s love for the city. Stiflingly hot and humid, from June to September, high temperatures are only broken by typhoons and rainstorms, during which the city endures torrential downpours that render umbrellas useless.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 7, 2008, more than 145 millimeters (5.7 inches) poured down on the city in 24 hours. That\\'s more than what Seattle, Washington receives most months. Photos from the storm show people trudging through knee deep water, and at least two people were killed in landslides caused by the torrential downpour. Credit: MIKE CLARKE/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nHong Kong has a color-coded warning system for rainstorms, from amber to black, issued by the Observatory and sent to millions of residents\\' mobile phones. Building on a system introduced in 1967 , the alerts warn people when to avoid unnecessary travel due to the danger of road accidents, or even landslides caused by rain in some mountainous parts of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nOffices and schools shut during black rain, which is defined as when more than 70 millimeters (2.7 inches) per hour. While black rain causes minor flooding -- mainly due to the impermeability of tarmac and concrete -- thanks to the giant underground tunnels, it is nothing compared to the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deadliest typhoon hit the city in September 1906, killing an estimated 15,000 people, according to Hong Kong Observatory , 5% of the city\\'s then population of 320,000. In the 1960s and 70s, Hong Kong suffered hundreds of fatalities due to tropical cyclones. Thousands also lost their homes due to flooding, and the city had to spend millions on water damage repairs every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeavy urbanization only made flooding worse, as large areas of natural ground were paved over, swapping soluble grass and mud for concrete and tarmac, which rather than absorb rain, allowed water to accumulate in puddles or, worse, cause flood. Older areas of the city were also compromised, with drainage systems built for a far smaller population and to poor standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1995, the department has spent around $3.8 billion on various projects. That has included installing 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) of drains, 360 kilometers (224 miles) of river channels, four vast underground tunnels spanning 21 kilometers (13 miles), and four stormwater storage tanks. Another 11 tanks are being constructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel is the largest of four, and runs through the mountains above Tin Hau, in the eastern part of the island, past the busy financial districts of Admiralty and Central, to Cyberport on the western coast. At its widest, the tunnel is 7.25 meters in diameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt slopes gradually downward so the water is carried out by gravity, though pumps can also be engaged for heavy flow. Even on a dry day, water streams down a nearby intake from high above in the mountains. The intake looks like an artificial waterfall made of concrete steps designed to slow down the flow. Far from smelling like a drain, the water heading into the tunnel has little aroma, and looks a river.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the tunnel\\'s intakes, full of rainwater.

So, rural villages and towns can be protected with dykes and channels dug to redirect or temporarily store the water, while heavily built-up, urban areas require more intensive engineering work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese solutions, which direct rainwater away from vulnerable areas and eventually return it to the ocean, have helped to reduce the number of flooding blackspots from 126 in 1995, to just five today.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Leung, the DSD\\'s senior engineer, won\\'t be drawn on whether all this has been value for money, but for context, flooding in southern China led to economic losses of more than $2.9 billion (20 billion RMB) in June alone\\r\\n\\r\\nRacecourse storage\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the largest storage tanks in Hong Kong lies beneath one of its best-known landmarks: the Happy Valley Racecourse, where, before coronavirus, tens of thousands of gamblers bet on weekly horse races. Hundreds more use the grounds as an outdoor running track, football pitch, and rugby field during the rest of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would never know this was here from the outside,\" Lau says inside the tank. The concrete floor is streaked with mud and dotted with small puddles. Small stones, silt and leaves are partially lit by fluorescent lights that do little to illuminate the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chamber looks like a vast, empty underground car park. At its fullest, it can hold up to 60,000 square meters of water, or the equivalent to 24 standard swimming pools.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater pours into the Happy Valley rainwater storage tank during a storm.

Some of the water that falls on the racecourse is collected and reused, for irrigation and to flush toilets in nearby housing estates.\\r\\n\\r\\nA model of the reservoir that sits under the Happy Valley Racecourse. Credit: Joshua Berlinger, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging climate\\r\\n\\r\\nThe achievement of Hong Kong\\'s anti-flood strategy cannot be overstated. Combined with the city\\'s typhoon warning and protection systems -- such as storm surge barriers -- it has made weather that is disastrous in many other parts of southeast Asia a mere annoyance for most Hong Kongers.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery year during the summer rains, storms that wash over Hong Kong, their deluge diverted by the tunnels and stored in tanks, can devastate parts of neighboring Guangdong by destroying buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHong Kong is not alone in dealing with flooding effectively, and the city\\'s engineers regularly collaborate with international and regional partners to share best practices and solutions. That is becoming ever more important as the changing climate brings more unpredictable and dangerous weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Typhoon Mangkhut battered the city in 2018, the Hong Kong Observatory\\'s senior scientific officer Ping-Wah Li told CNN , \"rain from tropical cyclones will increase ... and sea levels will continue to rise, increasing the threat of storm surges and coastal inundations,\" due to global warming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inside of the reservoir under Happy Valley Race Course. Credit: Joshua Berlinger/CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward Ng, professor of architecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that some work had been done to bolster Hong Kong defenses, but that \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" are needed to properly defend the coast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The design standard is based on past history,\" he said in a previous interview. \"It can cope with what happened thirty years ago, but not with what will happen in the next fifty years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeung, the DSD senior engineer, is also wary of being caught out by complacency, saying the city\\'s current defenses are sufficient only at present, and may be surpassed in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as continuing with engineering works like building tanks and tunnels, he believes adjustments to the city\\'s design and architecture can help combat the risks of climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose design solutions could include porous pavements, protected wetlands, rain gardens, and green rooftops, all of which can help absorb rainfall. So-called \"sponge cities\" have already been trialed in China , with some success.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man wades across the flood in Heng Fa Chuen during the approach of super Typhoon Mangkhut to Hong Kong on September 16, 2018. Credit: Philip Fong/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as the climate crisis leads to rising sea levels and serious flooding in some parts of the world, it is also having a major effect on global water resources, with the number of countries dealing with extreme water crises growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeung said that in cities like Hong Kong that are inundated with rainfall, there needs to be a reimagining of how to deal with water. Beyond just intercepting and diverting it, there should be more tactics for storing, purifying and reusing it, thus reducing the pressure on existing water resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, some rain is collected and reused for irrigation and flushing water, but most is still dumped back into the sea, a bitter situation for a city that imports over 70% of its fresh water from across the border in mainland China. With rising temperatures potentially leading to greater water-insecurity around the world, Hong Kong\\'s ability to do more with the water that literally falls upon it is more important than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the past, we just discharged, but now we\\'re talking about using the water as much as possible,\" Leung said. \"We don\\'t know exactly how it is changing, but we know the climate is changing, so we have to be prepared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN\\'s Joshua Berlinger contributed photos and additional reporting.

       " 'Brad Lendon , CNN Written by\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a story about a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate, arms manufacturers, a German peace group and renegades who make miniaturized weapons systems out of small shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that those tiny weapons could actually hurt anyone. Well, not unless you stepped on one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conglomerate is LEGO, with worldwide revenues of $6.2 billion in 2019 from its toys, retail stores, theme parks and even movie rights. Its toy sets -- which are intended to \"inspire the builders of tomorrow,\" according to the company\\'s mission statement -- run the gamut, from skyscrapers to boats, police stations to castles. There\\'s even a kit to make Rome\\'s famous Colosseum . Nothing from the real world, it seems, is off limits. That is, except for anything modeled on today\\'s military.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have a long-standing policy of not creating sets which feature real military vehicles that are currently in use,\" Ryan Greenwood, a spokesman for the company, said in an email to CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut during the summer, the Danish company released a set for the V-22 Osprey, a tiltrotor aircraft manufactured by Boeing and Bell Helicopter Textron that is only used by the American and Japanese militaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGO pulled its V-22 Osprey amid protests from a German anti-war group. Credit: LEGO\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kit, set to launch under LEGO\\'s vehicle-focused Technic brand, depicted a search and rescue version of the Osprey. But it drew a quick, harsh protest from the German Peace Society -- United War Resisters (DFG-VK in German), an almost 130-year-old anti-war group.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe V-22 Osprey, the group said, has been involved in conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Yemen and Syria. In a press release criticizing LEGO over the model, the DFG-VK then threw the toymaker\\'s own words from a decade earlier right back at it:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The basic aim is to avoid realistic weapons and military equipment that children may recognize from hot spots around the world and to refrain from showing violent or frightening situations when communicating about LEGO products. At the same time, the purpose is for the LEGO brand not to be associated with issues that glorify conflicts and unethical or harmful behavior,\" the peace group quoted from a 2010 LEGO report.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGO quickly pulled the motorized aircraft model from its inventory in late July. The few sets that had already hit store shelves made their way into the hands LEGO enthusiasts and onto internet trading sites at prices as high as $1,000 for a set that would\\'ve retailed at around $120.\\r\\n\\r\\nUS Air Force V-22 Ospreys take off from a base in New Mexico.

Credit: LEGO\\r\\n\\r\\nGreenwood, the company spokesperson, refused to comment further on why LEGO changed its mind on the Osprey model or why it was produced in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut LEGO canceling its Osprey set hasn\\'t stopped fans from creating their own versions. In a video interview from Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dan Siskind pulled up a large model of the aircraft to the camera. Although built from LEGO pieces, this one is bigger and, arguably, even more elaborate and life-like. He spun its tiltrotor propellers in a hand-held simulated flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSiskind is a former \"master builder,\" the top LEGO designers who assemble the models you find displayed in stores. He is now part of a subculture that unites adult fans of LEGO (or AFOLs as they are known) and military buffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough his company, Brickmania Toyworks , the 51-year-old takes the iconic bricks and turns them into custom military building kits spanning eras and multiple wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn arms bazaar for AFOLs, his inventory includes a US F-16 fighter ($425), a Russian T-80BVM main battle tank ($340) and even a Phalanx close-in weapon system, the rapid-fire Gatling gun the US Navy puts on its warships to knock out incoming threats like missiles or speedboats ($175).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also historical options, such as a Vietnam War-era Soviet MiG-21 fighter, a World War II Japanese A6M2 Zero or British Spitfire Mk I fighter plane, a US M4A3 Sherman or German Panzer IV Ausf G tank, or a World War I British biplane, all priced around $200.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those with lower budgets, micro military vehicle sets are sold for around $20.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parts are almost all genuine, made with new-condition LEGO bricks. But while the Danish company does not endorse its products being used for these purposes, it tolerates the practice, Siskind said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'ve given us some guidelines -- here\\'s how to stay out of trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe\\'s nonetheless blunt in describing his job. \"It\\'s just stuff we\\'ve taken that weren\\'t supposed to be made into military things, (that) we\\'ve made into military things,\" Siskind explained. \"Ordinary LEGO bricks just used in a way they were never intended to be used.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause he isn\\'t allowed to purchase bricks directly from LEGO for his military sets, sourcing is \"one big, continuous scavenger hunt\" that requires his staff to comb through Walmarts, Targets and toy stores for discounts on original sets. The company also uses the website Bricklink, a kind of eBay for LEGO parts, where specific bricks can be bought and sold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AC-130 Spooky II gunship model, made using LEGO bricks and other aftermarket parts, from Brickmania Toyworks in Minneapolis. Credit: Courtesy Brickmania Toyworks\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the parts are brought to Brickmania\\'s Minneapolis headquarters, where they are broken down and reallocated to the new kits, including its most expensive design: a Lockheed Martin AC-130 \"Spooky II\" gunship that contains more than 5,200 pieces and sells for $3,755.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn real life, an AC-130 gunship is one of the most terrifying aircraft imaginable. Armed with 40mm and 105mm cannons and a 25mm Gatling gun, it can devastate an area in seconds, earning it the nickname the \"Angel of Death\" in military circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the company made the first 25 models available, they sold out in five hours. A second batch then went in the same amount of time, Siskind said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have more demand than we can keep up with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Siskind will sell you a military kit, his company also encourages AFOLs to produce their own creations, sponsoring regular contests at Brickmania\\'s flagship store in Minneapolis. Among the rules: They must be military or war-themed, bear no Nazi symbols, display no excessive gore and are not of the sci-fi or fantasy genres.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal community\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople entering the competitions should probably be thankful that Ralph Savelsberg lives thousands of miles away in the Netherlands -- because the 45-year-old Dutch builder\\'s portfolio of LEGO-based military creations would likely be easy winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a Vietnam-era US Navy patrol boat, a Cold War-era intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), an Iranian F-14 fighter, an M-21 reconnaissance jet and a massive and stunning recreation of a B-52 bomber, the mainstay of the US Air Force\\'s bomber fleet for more than six decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nDutch LEGO builder Ralph Savelsberg shows off a model he made of a US Air Force B-52 bomber with a 5-foot wingspan.

I do get a lot of requests, but I always disappoint them; I have no interest whatsoever in having to deal with customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Furthermore, making plans or instructions is no fun, so I don\\'t actually have any plans for most of my models,\" he said in an email.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat he does enjoy is getting together with LEGO military builders from around the world at various conventions, where they share creations and even make custom ones to commemorate anniversaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this year\\'s Brickfair Virginia, Savelsberg and a few dozen military builders planned a display themed on the Cold War, including his ICBM. The event was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but Savelsberg plans to return next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGO-style military models on display at Brickfest Japan 2019 in Kobe.

For every builder who is willing and able to travel to events, there might be two dozen teenagers who rarely get out of their bedrooms and share their builds with a group of friends via social media,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin Chua, who runs LEGO aftermarket store Lioncity Mocs in Singapore, says this 1:100-scale model of a Singaporean littoral mission ship took him more than two months to plan, source parts and assemble.

Credit: Courtesy Ralph Savelsberg\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGO traces its roots back to Denmark in the 1930s, when carpenter Ole Kirk Kristiansen abbreviated the Danish words \"Leg Godt,\" meaning \"play well\" in English, to brand the wooden toys he was producing. It turned to plastic bricks in 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, Kristiansen\\'s son Godtfred launched LEGO bricks as a system, embracing the idea that the more you have, the more things you can make. \"Our idea has been to create a toy that prepares the child for life -- appealing to its imagination and developing the creative urge and joy of creation that are the driving forces in every human being,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, wheels and human figures were introduced in 1962 and 1978 respectively. And in 1989, miniature human figures sporting more facial expressions than the usual slight smile also emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGO has also been determined to put smiles on the faces of children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a family-owned company with a long-term mission, the LEGO Group is uniquely placed to deliver a positive impact on children, society and the planet,\" the company profile says. The 25-page company document mentions the words \"child\" or \"children\" nearly 100 times.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, as LEGO grew over the years, so did the presence of weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 report analyzing the company\\'s products, published on the peer-reviewed scientific investigation journal PLOS One , argues that LEGO sets \"are not as innocent as they used to be\" and have become increasingly violent over time. Since 1978, when the first weapon bricks -- a sword, a halberd and a lance -- were added to castle-themed LEGO sets, there the amount of weaponry has increased each year, according to the study. It found that by 2014, nearly 30% of sets contained at least one weapon brick.\\r\\n\\r\\nA LEGO James Bond Aston Martin set on the shelf of a Hong Kong store. Credit: Brad Lendon/CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of this increase can be attributed to movie-themed sets. For example, the company\\'s summer 2020 catalog features a model of the Aston Martin, the famous car driven by British spy James Bond. It comes complete with \"a wealth of sophisticated details and 007 gadgetry, including rotating license plates, ejector seat, tire scythes and front-wing machine guns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s also \"Star Wars\" X-wing fighters and Imperial star destroyers, and sets depicting \"Minecraft\" battles, with axes, bludgeons and cases of TNT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to the LEGO\\'s ethical red lines, Siskind sees a disconnect in the company\\'s logic. Is there really a difference between the Death Star or the violence of a galaxy far, far away and the machines that kill people here on Earth?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s very direct historical connections between the \\'Star Wars\\' world and World War II,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing LEGO\\'s rules\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his office in Atlanta, Andrew Roberts, co-owner of Battle Brick Customs , another aftermarket retailer, expresses what he sees as the LEGO dilemma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"LEGO has always kind of struggled with filling boys\\' desires for action and adventure (while) staying true to themselves (by) not doing realistic military things,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time, the company even went so far as to avoid gray-colored bricks (the obvious color choice for building military weapons and vehicles), Roberts claimed, saying early castle sets were made from yellow ones. (Siskind, too, recalled some rather colorful medieval builds, saying: \"When I was a kid all my castles were red because I had the most of that color.\")\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGO\\'s avoidance of modern military themes provided an opening, Roberts added. He turned his college pastime -- messing with his old LEGO sets -- into a full-time job, churning out best-sellers like World War II M4 Sherman tanks and modern Gulf War M1 Abrahms tanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think they like what I do but at the same time ... They tolerate me because I obey the rules.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA US Special Forces team in LEGO-style figures from Battle Brick Customs. Credit: Courtesy Battle Brick Customs\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, Roberts buys minifigures from LEGO, strips them of their paint and markings, and turns them into soldiers, sailors and airmen to stand watch in the military-themed sets he sells. He likens it to how a custom car shop takes a showroom model and turns it into a street racer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'re a shop selling custom Ford Mustangs, you can do that -- people have to know that this is a Ford Mustang, but it\\'s not an official Ford product,\" Roberts said. \"I took a Ford and I did a bunch of stuff to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of LEGO parts, he added, \"It\\'s a genuine LEGO minifigure that has had a bunch of aftermarket stuff done to it. I bought it, and it\\'s mine. And I\\'m customizing it, and I\\'m not pretending they did it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA figure stylized as a US soldier from Battle Brick Customs. Credit: Courtesy Battle Brick Customs\\r\\n\\r\\nFor much of the fanatic LEGO-building community, the \"it\\'s mine\" mentality -- a personal stake in what they make -- is what\\'s fun and what fills them with pride. And they\\'re not going to let the company\\'s ethos get in the way of their creations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the company pulled the Osprey in the summer, The Brothers Brick, an independent, reader-funded website for LEGO enthusiasts, carried several posts about the set\\'s demise. One showed a futuristic olive green vision of an Osprey with orange highlights, created by builder Simon Liu, using LEGO bricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrothers Brick contributor, Lino -- a Washington state-based artist and humorist, according to his biography -- drew inspiration from Liu\\'s creation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The point of showing you this is, while LEGO occasionally makes doofus decisions, they provide the pieces so that you can build anything you want. Who needs directions and an official set?\" Lino wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With LEGO bricks and a bit of imagination, the world is your oyster. Or Osprey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTop image caption: A figurine from Battle Brick Customs of a US soldier emerging from an armored personnel carrier.',\n",
       " 'From Auckland to Bogota, urban planners are already adapting our cities to lockdown. But will the changes last, and which more radical design proposals -- be it sewer monitors or \"epidemic skyscrapers\" -- will shape the post-pandemic city?\\r\\n\\r\\nOur cities may never look the same again after the pandemic\\r\\n\\r\\nFor advocates of walkable, unpolluted and vehicle-free cities , the past few weeks have offered an unprecedented opportunity to test the ideas they have long lobbied for.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Covid-19 lockdowns vastly reducing the use of roads and public transit systems, city authorities -- from Liverpool to Lima -- are taking advantage by closing streets to cars, opening others to bicycles and widening sidewalks to help residents maintain the six-foot distancing recommended by global health authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Oakland, California, almost 10% of roadways have been closed to through-traffic, while Bogota , Colombia, has opened 47 miles of temporary bike lanes. New York has begun trialing seven miles of \"open streets\" to ease crowding in parks, with Auckland Mexico City and Quito among the dozens of other world cities experimenting with similar measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many purported benefits of \"reclaiming\" the streets during a pandemic. Encouraging cycling may reduce crowding on buses and subways, where people can struggle to get distance from one another. Vehicle-free roads also offer those without access to parks the ability to exercise safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman cycles through a bike lane in central Milan. Credit: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nOther urban initiatives have been introduced to directly control the spread of the virus. Cities in the US, Canada and Australia have reconfigured traffic lights so that people no longer need to touch crosswalk buttons. (In any case, many pedestrian crossings are equipped with \" placebo buttons \" that have no impact on whether the lights go green).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unclear if these urban interventions will continue once the pandemic is over. Milan plans to build 22 miles of new cycle lanes and permanently widen sidewalks after its lockdown lifts. Authorities in Hungary\\'s capital, Budapest, have suggested that its new bike lanes may become permanent if the measures \"prove favorable,\" while planning officials in Providence, Rhode Island, have said crossings will now remain button-free\\r\\n\\r\\nBut few other cities have been so committal. And it will be harder to make the case for pedestrian- and cycle-friendly streets once their benefits are weighed against the knock-on effects of congestion elsewhere -- especially in countries as dependent on cars as the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the cities in which pandemic-era measures seem most likely to stick are those already committed to change. Take Paris, for instance, where more than 400 miles of pop-up bike lanes (or \"coronapistes\") are set to open when France\\'s national lockdown ends on May 11. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has called returning to a car-dominated status quo \"out of the question,\" but she was already backing a huge overhaul of biking in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recently expanded bike track in Berlin\\'s Kreuzberg district.

But urban planning is a long game in which change is piecemeal and the legacies of past decisions take time to overcome. Public spaces and amenities cannot always be expanded or reconfigured at will.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, looking to the coming years rather than the coming months, how else might the virus -- or attempts to prevent future ones -- re-shape our cities?\\r\\n\\r\\nReimagining public space\\r\\n\\r\\nParc de la Distance, a speculative proposal by Austrian design studio Precht, imagines a public park made from a maze-like network of three-foot-wide hedges. The layout provides 20-minute walking routes that can, in theory, be completed while maintaining distance from others, thanks to gates indicating when paths are occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustrian design studio Precht has imagined a maze-like public park that encourages social distancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech firm Hua Hua Architects has meanwhile proposed a \" Gastro Safe Zone \" (pictured top) which uses brightly colored ground markings to encourage passersby to keep their distance from al fresco diners. And in Milan, one of the cities worst hit by Covid-19, designer Antonio Lanzillo has envisaged public benches equipped with acrylic glass \"shield\" dividers\\r\\n\\r\\nOther ideas have ranged from self-disinfecting \"smart\" elevators to door handles that can be easily operated with elbows , rather than hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is too soon to know which, if any, may be realized. But each idea suggests that the practice of social distancing and unease over shared surfaces could continue long after the current crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c Planners talk about creating \\'sticky\\' streets -- places where people linger and stay around. So the question now is: Will those efforts continue, or how will they need to be changed? Can we still achieve connectivity if we all keep social distancing? â\\x80\\x9d Jordi Honey-RosÃ©s\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they do, the widely-publicized six-foot distancing guidelines could redefine the layout and spacing of new public facilities, according to Northeastern University\\'s Sara Jensen Carr, whose forthcoming book \" The Topography of Wellness \" considers how urban landscapes have been transformed by epidemics like cholera, tuberculosis and obesity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everybody from Daniel Burnham -- who was the planner of Chicago -- to Le Corbusier came up with arbitrary measurements on their own,\" she said in a phone interview. \"Le Corbusier writes extensively that every \\'unit\\' in the Radiant City (or \"Ville Radieuse,\" the celebrated architect\\'s proposed utopia) needed a specific amount of light ... and a certain amount of cubic feet of air to circulate within it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So six feet could be the new unit we use when we think about cities and public parks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, the idea of keeping people apart seems to contradict the emphasis planners have traditionally placed on human interaction. Architects, whether designing parks or social housing, have often valued meeting points as sources of collaboration, inclusion and community-building.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That contradiction is very interesting,\" said associate professor at the University of British Columbia, Jordi Honey-RosÃ©s, who co-authored one of the first academic studies into the potential impact of Covid-19 on public space.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In fact, if you look at the literature on the health benefits of green spaces, one of the primary (advantages) is social connectivity -- people seeing their neighbors and being part of a community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Planners talk about creating \\'sticky\\' streets -- places where people linger and stay around,\" he added, speaking on the phone from lockdown in Barcelona. \"So the question now is: Will those efforts continue, or how will they need to be changed?

Credit: Antonio Lanzillo & Partners\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than outlining solutions at this early stage, Honey-RosÃ©s\\' paper (which, subject to peer review, is set to publish in the journal Cities & Health) instead lays out the questions facing urban planners. Many relate to how cities manage the green spaces that he thinks \"will, overall, be more valued and more appreciated\" after the current crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to their well-documented health and psychological benefits, greener cities may also be more resilient to future pandemics. A recent Harvard study has indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 in the US, while Italian scientists have detected the virus on pollutant particles (and are looking at whether pollution may aid its spread).\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither line of inquiry has yielded conclusive results. But should a definitive link between pollution and the virus emerge, it would \"really be a game-changer\" for green urban planning, Honey-RosÃ©s said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, cities will be able to say, \\'We\\'re going to redesign our streets not only because we need social and physical distance, but because we need to increase our probability of survival,\" he suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nA matter of density\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest questions may center around population density.

NYC must develop an immediate plan to reduce density.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo will there be a long-term push for cities to sprawl outwards in order to reduce downtown populations?\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Carr, the backlash against city centers may be especially acute in America, where high rates of car ownership make suburban life less inconvenient. \"The United States has always been a country that somewhat fears density,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit: miss3/Hua Hua Architects\\r\\n\\r\\nA proposed \"Gastro Safe Zone,\" which uses brightly colored ground markings to encourage passersby to keep their distance from outdoor diners. Credit: Hary Marwel/Hua Hua Architects\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she, like other experts, worries that a potential retreat from cities will come at a cost. After all, density makes mass transit systems viable, improves access to public facilities (including hospitals) and promotes innovation and creativity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think as designers and urban planners we have to think about how we emphasize the benefits of density,\" Carr added. \"Because now, whenever anyone tries to build new housing anywhere, it\\'s probably going to be the first question that people have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before the development of germ theory, people have distrusted the benefits of living in close quarters. The Victorians\\' widespread belief that miasma (or \"bad air\") helped spread disease partly justified the clearance of London\\'s 19th-century slums. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, the perils of density were seemingly laid bare when faulty plumbing saw the deadly virus sweep through Hong Kong\\'s Amoy Gardens housing estate.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c Six feet could be the new unit we use when we think about cities and public parks. â\\x80\\x9d Sara Jensen Carr\\r\\n\\r\\nsparser cities in Europe and the US. Robert Steuteville, editor of the journal Public Square, has But there is not, yet, any clear evidence linking population density to the spread of Covid-19.

Robert Steuteville, editor of the journal Public Square, has argued that data from the US (such as the high transmission rates in the relatively sparsely-populated New Orleans, for instance) disprove what he calls the \"\\'density is dangerous\\' narrative.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the use of public transport is a significant factor in Covid-19\\'s spread is a theory still being explored. And while, again, the findings remain far from conclusive, mistrust of buses and subways may nonetheless see their use decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoney-RosÃ©s suggested we may instead see the growth of \"micromobility\" -- vehicles like scooters and e-bikes -- though this could be accompanied by reduced demand for initiatives like bike-sharing schemes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sharing model is going to have additional costs related to hygiene and cleaning, which will be very challenging,\" he said, adding that sharing schemes \"might get hurt in this pandemic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA man rides an electric scooter across the Parco Sempione park in Milan.

Later that century, sanatoria built to treat tuberculosis came to inspire the white, clinical aesthetic of modernist architecture (while beliefs the disease could be remedied by sunlight influenced the movement\\'s penchant for terraces and roof gardens, according to Carr).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo although considering the impact of Covid-19 is, at this stage, largely speculative, there\\'s plenty of scope for innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps we\\'ll see the widespread adoption of automatic doors. Perhaps the popularity of urban farming in recent months will offer new relief from the threat of bare supermarket shelves. Or perhaps the installation of sewage monitors will be used to decipher if -- and where -- certain diseases are growing among city populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent skyscraper design competition was won by a prefabricated emergency healthcare tower dubbed \"Epidemic Babel.\" Credit: Gavin Shen/Weiyuan Xu/Xinhao Yuan\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been more outlandish ideas, still.

But he caveated this by saying politics and opportunism may play significant roles in dictating which ideas come to fruition.

Around the world, rainbow flags fly high and revelers turn their faces proudly towards the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe multicolored flag has united the LGBTQ community for over 40 years, and though it remains a universal symbol of pride, liberation didn\\'t always come in vibrant technicolor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact lavender -- a subtle hue that shifts between light pinkish purples, and gray and blueish tones -- has had, despite its whimsical nature, its own historical significance in representing resistance and power.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe making of a color trend\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many aspects of queer culture, it\\'s not surprising that lavender\\'s unique color symbolism often skirts under the radar, especially when it comes to mainstream society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Western culture it started life as a color of desire, thanks to the lyric genius of 7th century BC poet Sappho, whose papyrus fragments told of her erotic predilections for younger women with \"violet tiaras.\" Fast forward a few centuries, and in the 1920s, violets were still drawing together members of the lesbian community, who gifted the delicate flowers as an expression of sapphic interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an illustration from 1833 in France, a woman is pictured wearing a floral dress with purple velvet inserts.

Aestheticism, a European arts movement was founded, eschewing Victorian wholesomeness and the perceived ugliness of the industrial age, in favor of beauty, passion and \"art for art\\'s sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNewspapers denounced Aesthetes as effeminate, not least one of the prominent leaders of the movement, Oscar Wilde, who frequently reminisced about his \"purple hours\" spent with rent boys, and provoked a moral scandal with the homoerotic themes in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fight for visibility\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1930s marked the start of a dark period when lavender was cruelly lexicalized. Gay men in America were taunted for possessing a \"dash\" or \"streak\" of lavender, thanks in large part to Abraham Lincoln\\'s biographer Carl Sandburg, who described one of the president\\'s early male friendships as containing a \"streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the McCarthy era, there was state-sanctioned discrimination when president Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450, which became part of a national witch-hunt to purge homosexual men and women from the federal government. Dubbed \"The Lavender Scare\" by historian David K. Johnson, the suffocating climate of fear and suspicion subsequently led to around 5,000 federal agency employees losing their jobs on the basis of their sexuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of women, one dressed as Greek poet Sappho, gather on the National Mall before the Equal Rights Amendment March. Credit: Ann E. Zelle/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, the color came to symbolize empowerment. Lavender sashes and armbands were distributed to a crowd of hundreds in a \"gay power\" march from Washington Square Park to Stonewall Inn in New York, to commemorate the Stonewall riots that had just taken place a month before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also the year president of the National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan, denounced the lesbian membership she believed would threaten the feminist movement as a \"Lavender Menace.\" This time, there was backlash. At the 1970 Second Congress to Unite Women, a group of radical activists wearing hand-dyed purple T-shirts printed with the words \"Lavender Menace\" stormed the stage and kickstarted a conversation on the very topic Friedan had struggled to suppress: lesbianism.\\r\\n\\r\\nLavender, however, can\\'t always be neatly defined in terms of pain or protest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout history, there are endless references to its subversive possibilities, allowing LGBTQ people to express the full range of their humanity. Take the late actor and writer Quentin Crisp, whose lavender tresses were a way of visually disrupting gender norms, right up until his 90th birthday, when he held a party complete with lavender \"napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp at New York\\'s Gay Pride parade in June 1982.

He also cited violet, mallow (mauve) and lavender among the \"colours of Eden\" missing from God\\'s rainbow in his work \"Chroma: A Book of Colour.\" Then, of course, there\\'s Gilbert Baker\\'s rainbow flag, which he lovingly re-worked in 2017 with a lavender stripe to \" represent diversity in the era of Trump.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving color\\r\\n\\r\\nThese days, the color is being worn with confidence, nonchalance and something that feels like defiance; a nod, perhaps, to the radical protest spirit of the \\'70s. \"Most simplistically, fashion tends to be cyclical, so colors that haven\\'t been in the public eye for a while are often picked up and reinterpreted by designers,\" said St Clair. \"The interlude allows the designers to reinvigorate them: they feel fresh all over again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA model presents a creation by Loewe during the Women\\'s Spring-Summer 2020 Ready-to-Wear collection fashion show in Paris on September 27, 2019.

       " 'Monica Sarkar , CNN Written by\\r\\n\\r\\nBollywood may be best known for its glamorous casts, glitzy costumes and energetic dance routines. But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s actually racism,\" said award-winning film director Neeraj Ghaywan. \"Let\\'s not mince our words.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the concepts of blackface and brownface date back to the 19th century , when white performers would darken their faces with makeup, and use racist stereotypes to portray black and other ethnic minority characters. White performers did this in a time when non-white professionals were themselves barred from employment in the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the practice dates back even further in England, to the Elizabethan era, when directors traditionally cast white actors to play minority characters in Shakespearean plays. Even into recent decades, the African general in \"Othello\" has long been played by a white actor with darkened skin, including Orson Welles in 1951 and Laurence Olivier in 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s also appeared in modern films. Dan Aykroyd wore blackface and dreadlocks in 1983\\'s \"Trading Places,\" and Robert Downey Jr. appeared several shades darker in 2008\\'s \"Tropic Thunder,\" to play a white Australian method actor who darkened his skin to play a black man in a Vietnam war film.\\r\\n\\r\\nBollywood has adopted brownface in a number of films -- by temporarily darkening the skin of performers, especially when they are portraying characters from disadvantaged backgrounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in the early days of Hollywood, critics of this practice say that Bollywood often prefers this approach to actually hiring performers who have naturally darker skin, thus perpetuating discrimination and inequality in the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the popular 2019 film \"Bala\" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman was played by famed actress Bhumi Pednekar (pictured above), who had her skin darkened in order to play the role. The move was slammed by some Indian media outlets, commentators and on social media.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome pointed out the irony of one of the film\\'s promotional posters tweeted by Pednekar, where her character was \"surrounded by skin lightening products (and) is actually lightskinned and in brownface.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPednekar defended the director\\'s decision to cast her in the movie, according to Indian media reports, saying factors apart from physical appearance play a major role: \"If a filmmaker has taken me, it is because I add some value to the film.\" â\\x80\\x8b\\r\\n\\r\\nThe director, Amar Kaushik, told the Press Trust of India he \"thought about casting a dark-skinned actor,\" but \"felt Bhumi was superb for this character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN reached out to Pednekar via her agent and Kaushik for comment, but both â\\x80\\x8bdeclined to comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA screengrab of Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in a trailer for the 2019 Bollywood movie \"Super 30.\" The film was criticized for darkening the skin of the actor who played the role of a teacher from the state of Bihar, which the World Bank describes as \"one of India\\'s poorest states.\" Credit: Reliance Entertainment/Youtube\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popularity of films that use brownface, such as box office hits \"Super 30\" and \"Gully Boy,\" also released in 2019, suggest that Bollywood â\\x80\\x8bis yet to come under significant public pressure for a practice that many people consider racist and offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nBollywood actor Hrithik Roshan attends Hindu religious celebrations in Mumbai on October 7, 2019.

To be dark is to be a manual laborer, working in the sun. Fair skin is also a mark of class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival of pale-skinned British colonial leaders in the 18th century also had a role to play, deepening the prejudice, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the colonial era, race and racism functioned in the context of the so-called mixed-race populations, the Anglo-Indians. The \\'closer\\' you were to a white progenitor, the higher up in the hierarchy of race.\" British rule is also blamed for further polarizing the castes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFairness, on the other hand, is revered and considered a sign of beauty and status. \"Bollywood, and Indian cinema generally, had two remarkable antecedents: religious iconography and Parsi theater,\" said Vijay Mishra, a Professor of English Literature at Australia\\'s Murdoch University and the author of \"Bollywood cinema: Temples of desire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For both, \\'whiteness\\' was essential,\" Mishra said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHindu gods and goddesses are \"remarkably white,\" except for dark-skinned Shiva, Rama and Krishna, he said. In Parsi theater, \"Parsis, through their Iranian ethnicity, are extremely fair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia\\'s independence in 1947 paved the way for a new constitution that outlawed caste-based discrimination, but it is still prevalent in parts of India. In its 2019 World Report , Human Rights Watch noted that Dalits, formerly referred to as \"untouchables,\" \"continued to be discriminated against in education and in jobs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd colorism, discrimination based on the color of someone\\'s skin, is prevalent in Bollywood, Srivastava argued. â\\x80\\x8b\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colorism is not problematized at all, since a vast number of Bollywood cinema relies upon prejudice as a vehicle for entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be considered perfectly natural that they would don brownface to portray a dark character...

But in 2014, analysis by The Hindu newspaper found that only two Bollywood movies made that year had featured a lower caste character in a leading role.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Ghaywan argued that the root of the problem is that caste discrimination is deeply entrenched in India and that Bollywood is merely reflecting society\\'s ideals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have been so internalized through our cinema itself,\" he said, referring to an early example of the 1957 Indian epic \"Mother India,\" where actor Sunil Dutt\\'s skin was darkened to play the role of a farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We internalize it so much that it is part of a muscle memory, and we don\\'t even think about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBollywood\\'s endorsement of fairness products\\r\\n\\r\\nBut â\\x80\\x8blike discrimination on the basis of caste, discrimination on the basis of skin color is not confined to the big, Bollywood screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeema Hari was born and raised in Mumbai.

Read more Beauty stories here\\r\\n\\r\\nFor centuries, hair dye has been pivotal in helping people portray a certain image -- to either fit in with the beauty standards of the day or to dramatically subvert them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen in particular have long tried to conform with the notion that female beauty comes with a glossy mane -- from blonde to black to dusted with gold or flour, depending on the time and place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Throughout history, the status of our hair has served as an instant visual cue for value judgment,\" said Caterina Gentili, PhD candidate at the Centre for Appearance Research in England, in a phone interview. \"One of the many ways for society to objectify female bodies, and deem them worthy, or not, of attention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent decades, Gentili said \"hair color products have become a key tool for women to stay visible, and shield them from one of the biggest stigmas placed on them: aging.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2025, the global hair color market is expected to be worth around $28 billion , up more than 8% on its estimated value of $17.8 billion in 2019, indicating continuing strong demand for hair-altering products.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the figures don\\'t show a small, growing trend among women to embrace their natural locks -- grays included -- as a statement against traditional gender expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, dying your hair is not solely about covering up imperfections; it\\'s about upending ideals, making a bold statement and reclaiming your natural hue.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom leeches and sulfuric acid to synthetic dyes\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its early iterations, hair coloring was done by both men and women to enhance their looks or hide white strands, according to Victoria Sherrow\\'s \"Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient civilizations used rudimentary hair colorants, based on recipes that included cassia bark, leeks, leeches, charred eggs, henna -- still commonly used across the Middle East and India -- and even gold dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Greeks favored gold and red-gold shades, associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, health and youthfulness. Likewise, high-class Greek and Roman prostitutes opted for blonde hues to suggest sensuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis advertisement for Circassian hair dye published in 1843 promises to change light hair into \"beautiful\" brown or black. Credit: Bettman Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t until the Middle Ages in Europe that hair dyeing began shifting into a predominantly female habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBleaches, often made with blended flowers, saffron and calf kidneys, were particularly in vogue, although Roman Catholics associated blond hair with lasciviousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nRed dyes, often a mix of saffron and sulfur powder -- the latter of which could induce nosebleeds and headaches, was popularized during the 16th-century reign of Elizabeth I of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hue was a favorite in Italian courts as well, thanks to Renaissance artist Titian, who painted female beauties with red-gold locks. In the 18th century, European elites favored perfumed white and pastel powders made from wheat flour dusted lightly onto natural hair and wigs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most hair dyes were composed of plants and animal products, the evolution of the practice also saw the use of dangerous, even lethal methods to change hair color: lead combs to darken it, or sulfuric acid to lighten it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1907, a young French chemist named Eugene Schueller used para-phenylenediamine (PPD), a chemical discovered in the previous century, for the world\\'s first synthetic dye, which he called \"OrÃ©al.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people\\'s fears of using manufactured hair color. In 1909, he decided to change it to something a little snappier: L\\'OrÃ©al.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shop assistant holds a color sample against a customer\\'s hair in 1965. Credit: Angelo Cozzi/Mondadori/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aging card\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first decades of the 20th century, women were fearful of commercial dye formulants. Chemical hair color was considered unsafe, and the practice itself had an image problem: as in the modest Victorian era, it was seen as something vain women, not respectable housewives, would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1940s, even as the beauty trend became more popular, salons offered back entrances for clients who didn\\'t want to make their dye habits known.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo expand their market, some beauty companies decided to tap into the anxiety around aging and sell color as a way to cover up gray hair. A black-and-white French L\\'OrÃ©al ad from the 1920s depicted a sad-looking woman next to a smiling version of herself in a black bob; the English translation reads: \"Not one more white hair; forever 30 years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA Clairol print campaign from 1943, \"Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator,\" declared: \"Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life... It can dictate many things you say or do. No wonder other women refuse to tolerate this tyrant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPressuring women to maintain their hair color as they aged \"was the marketing ploy that made hair dye as ubiquitous as using soap,\" said Claire Robinson, author of the essay \"Grey is a Feminist Issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While the ideal had been perpetuated for generations, the modern beauty industry pushed it in a more aggressive way, playing on insecurities (and) self-doubt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising companies also worked on normalizing dyes by selling them on their subtlety, such as the iconic 1956 Clairol ad \"Does she...or doesn\\'t she?,\" which was so popular that copywriter Shirley Polykoff\\'s slogan became a catchphrase in the States. Around that time, the debut of home-color kits also ensured privacy, paving the way for the widespread use of hair dye.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertisers saw an opportunity to market home coloring kits to women in the 1950s. Credit: Found Image Holdings/Corbis/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in the 1950s only 4-7% of American women dyed their hair, by the 1970s, the figure had risen to some 40%. By 2015, an estimated 70% of American women were using it. A 2019 OnePoll survey for haircare brand Living Proof showed similarly high figures in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South and East Asia, the picture is similar. In India, where the hair care industry is a $3.3 billion business, colorants account for 18% of the overall hair category and have been growing 15% a year, according to a report by Nielsen . Indian women are particularly fond of Garnier Black Naturals , owned by L\\'OrÃ©al, currently its highest selling hair dye brand globally.\\r\\n\\r\\nSales of hair colorants in the Middle East and Africa registered at $201.88 million in 2017, an increase of almost 10% over 2016, with bleachers as the market\\'s fastest growing segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina and South Korea have all seen a huge increase in demand for hair color products, mostly darker dyes, both for men and women. In Japan, the beauty ideal attached to black hair is so strong that some schools force students to dye their hair black, though in recent years the rule has provoked backlash.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut dyeing is no longer just about natural looks. Dip dyes and rainbow hues spanning pink, turquoise and violet have become fashionable for young women across the world and, to an extent, men (such as celebrities Jared Leto and Zayn Malik). Bright shades also began appearing on armpit hair, notably by Miley Cyrus.\\r\\n\\r\\nColor is now used to make a bold individual statement. Credit: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nRoxie Jane Hunt, a Seattle-based hair stylist who specializes in rainbow dyes, sees this new approach as a way \"to demonstrate personal choice and play around with identity,\" she said over the phone. \"A lot of women feel like they want to stand out, not blend in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Asia, South Koreans especially embraced rainbow dyes, from coral to ash to cherry pink. Chameleon-like hair changes even became a signature look for a number of K-pop stars -- so much so that a new hair color is often seen as signifier of a change in those artists\\' careers, be it a new album, single, or tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the last couple of years, a growing number of Asian women have also been going blond or full platinum -- a way for some to feel like a stronger version of themselves\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese twins Ami and Aya -- \"Amiya\" -- during Paris Fashion Week, March, 2020.

Credit: David Buchan/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the handful of famous women who have embraced it -- Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Jamie Lee Curtis, Theresa May, Christine Lagarde -- there\\'s a much larger segment of the entertainment, cultural and political worlds that have not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lack of white-haired role models or naturally graying young stylish icons isn\\'t at all surprising,\" Gentili said. \"For a long time, and still today, a woman with gray hair would conjure up images of a grandmother: wise and nurturing, but completely desexualized. Salt-and-pepper men on the other hand -- even that expression is so different! -- are seen as distinguished, charismatic, confident, experienced, sexy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a lot of women, the double standard feels ever-so stifling. Since Truslow Smith launched \" Grombre\" -- a play on gray and ombre -- in 2016, the Instagram account has garnered more than 174,000 followers, with dozens of women submitting photos of their gray heads daily. Truslow Smith, who found her first gray hair at 14 and decided to stop dyeing at 24, said it has encouraged positive conversations around the topic, but also served as a form of validation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Embracing natural gray hair truly is a lifestyle shift, not just a trend,\" she said. Most people who do it don\\'t usually return to dyeing. It\\'s a liberating decision.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe notices how young some of the posters are, and hopes the term \"premature graying,\" which describes people in their 20s and 30s, can be re-evaluated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it truly \\'premature graying,\\' or has hair dye been established as such a standard that we don\\'t know what natural looks like at certain ages?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it gray or lime green, embracing a color change outside of the established canon is, for many, a leap of faith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a form of self-expression,\" Hunt said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the more if you\\'re asserting yourself as a woman who is not afraid of aging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It takes courage,\" Gentili said. \"It\\'s a choice far more rebellious than any pink dye will ever be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTop image caption: Model Sita Abellan outside Paco Rabanne, during Paris Fashion Week on September 26, 2019.',\n",

Hair removal -- or otherwise -- has long shaped gender dynamics, served as a signifier of class and defined notions of femininity and the \"ideal body.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in its most recent evolution, body hair is being embraced by a growing number of young women who are turning a source of societal shame and turning it into a sign of personal strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rise of gender fluidity, the body-positivity movement and the beauty sector\\'s growing inclusiveness have all contributed to the new wave of hirsuteness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s been deeply stigmatized -- it still is -- and cast with shame,\" said Heather Widdows, professor of global ethics at the UK\\'s University of Birmingham and author of \"Perfect Me: Beauty as an Ethical Ideal,\" in a phone interview. \"Its removal is one of the few aesthetic traditions that have gone from being a beauty routine to a hygienic one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Today, most women feel like they have to shave. Like they have no other option. There\\'s something deeply fraught about that -- though perceptions are slowly changing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom ancient Egypt to Darwin\\r\\n\\r\\nA young woman undergoing hair-removal at the Beatiderm Institute of Electrolysis in New York on November 4, 1938. Credit: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nHairlessness wasn\\'t established as a mandate for women until the early 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore that, removing body hair was something both men and women did -- as far back as the Stone Age, then through ancient Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire -- using seashells, beeswax and various other depilatories. In these earlier eras, as Victoria Sherrow writes in \"Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History,\" hairlessness was seen mostly as a way to keep the body clean. Ancient Romans also associated it with class: The smoother your skin was, the purer and more superior you were.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Middle East, as well as East and South Asia, threading was used on the entire face. But unibrows were actually considered alluring for both sexes, and were often accentuated with kohl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThreading -- which removes facial hair -- has long been a traditional beauty procedure, as seen in this picture at a Taipei night market. A thin thread is doubled, then twisted and rolled over areas of unwanted hair, plucking the hair at the follicle level. Credit: Yeung Kwan//LightRocket/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Persia, hair removal and brow-shaping was a marker of adulthood and marriage for women, and was mainly reserved for that occasion. While in China, body hair was long considered normal, and even today woman face far less social pressure to shave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same goes for other countries in Asia: While hair removal has become routine for many of the continent\\'s young women, waxing or trimming pubic hair, for instance, isn\\'t as common as it is in the West.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, in Korea, pubic hair was long considered a sign of fertility and sexual health -- so much so that, in the mid-2010s, it was reported that some Korean women were undergoing pubic hair transplants, to add extra hair to their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropeans weren\\'t always obsessed with hair-free skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, good Catholic women were expected to let their hair grow as a display of femininity, while keeping it concealed in public. The face was the only place where hair was considered unsightly: 14th-century ladies would pluck the hair from their foreheads in order to push back their hairlines and give their faces a more oval appearance. When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558, she made eyebrow removal fashionable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late 18th century, hair removal still wasn\\'t considered essential by European and American women, although when the first safety razor for men was invented by French barber Jacques Perret in 1760, some women reportedly used them too.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t until the late 1800s that women on both sides of the Atlantic started making hair removal an integral part of their beauty routines. The modern-day notion of body hair being unwomanly can be traced back to Charles Darwin\\'s 1871 book \"Descent of a Man,\" according to Rebecca Herzig\\'s \"Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Paris, a patient undergoes a hair removal session using an Alexandrite laser. Credit: BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nDarwin\\'s theory of natural selection associated body hair with \"primitive ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier, \\'less developed\\' forms,\" wrote Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College in Maine. Conversely, having less body hair, the English naturalist suggested, was a sign of being more evolved and sexually attractive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Darwin\\'s ideas became popularized, other 19th-century medical and scientific experts began linking hairiness to \"sexual inversion, disease pathology, lunacy, and criminal violence,\" Herzig continued. Interestingly, those connotations were applied mostly to women\\'s body hair, not men\\'s -- not just because of evolutionary arguments but also, the author pointed out, the enforcement of \"gendered social control\" on women\\'s rising role in society. Making women think they had to be hairless to be considered worthy of attention was a heteronormative way of controlling their bodies -- and, inherently, their selves -- through shame, Widdows explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 1900s, upper- and middle-class white America increasingly saw smooth skin as a marker of femininity, and female body hair as disgusting, with its removal offering \"a way to separate oneself from cruder people, lower class and immigrant,\" Herzig wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nA female \\'necessity\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, changing fashions -- sleeveless dresses exposing the skin -- further popularized body hair removal in the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1915, Harper\\'s Bazaar was the first women\\'s magazine to run a campaign dedicated to the removal of underarm hair (\"a necessity,\" as it was described). That same year, men\\'s shaving company Gillette launched the first razor marketed specifically for women, the Milady DÃ©colletÃ©e. Its advert read, \"A beautiful addition to Milady\\'s toilet table -- and one that solves an embarrassing personal problem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shorter hemlines of the 1930s and \\'40s, and a shortage of nylon stockings during World War II meant more and more American women began shaving their legs, too. The introduction of the bikini in the US in 1946 also led shaving companies and female consumers to focus on the trimming and shaping of their nether regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nItalian actress Sophia Loren, wearing a white embroidered dress, posing for the photographer in Venice, 1955. Credit: Archivio Cameraphoto Epoche/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s, as Playboy hit the newsstands (its first issue came out in 1953), clean-shaven, lingerie-touting women set a new standard of sexiness. By 1964, 98% of American women aged 15 to 44 were regularly shaving their legs. Wax strips and the first laser hair removal also debuted around then, though the latter was quickly abandoned for its damaging effects on the skin before being reintroduced decades later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet shaving was far from being as extreme as it is today,\" Widdows said. \"In the late 1960s and 1970s, full bushes were not at all uncommon, even in Playboy. Around that time you also had the second wave of feminism and the spread of hippie culture, both of which rejected hairless bodies. For a lot of women, body hair was symbol of their fight for equality. It wasn\\'t seen as unnatural -- not yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat shift, Widdows said, kicked off in the following decades, with the rising popularity of waxing, pornography and increasingly explicit pop culture. In 1987, seven sisters from Brazil (known as the J Sisters) opened a salon in New York City offering the so-called \"Brazilian\" -- a complete wax hair removal of the genital region. Celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Campbell started doing it. The masses followed suit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Removing body hair went from being \\'expected\\' to the norm,\" Widdows explained. \"Being hairless has come to be seen as the only \\'natural\\' and clean way to present the body. Except it really isn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated video from CNN Beauty: The evolution of red lipstick\\r\\n\\r\\nWith advertising and media further promoting the ideal of hair-free bodies, the idea that female hair is gross has only grown. In turn, methods to achieve hairlessness have become more precise: The last four decades have seen the ascent of electrolysis, pulsed light and more advanced laser technology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything associated with the \\'abject\\' -- what we expel from our cultural worlds in order to define ourselves -- arouses disgust, shame and hostility almost by definition,\" Herzig told CNN in an email. \"Visible female body hair certainly tends to be treated as abject today. It\\'s worth noting that those are ideas about cleanliness, contingent social norms, rather than about actually removing \\'dirt.\\' Most hair removal practices tend to introduce new opportunities for abrasion and infection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEmbracing hairiness\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Breanne Fahs, professor of women and gender studies at Arizona State University, set female students an assignment to grow their body hair and write a paper reflecting on the experience. Fahs later extended the assignment to include the course\\'s men, who were asked to shave their legs. The project still runs today.\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican artist Frida Kahlo boasted a unibrow. Credit: Everett/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The assignment has spotlighted the cultural inevitability of female hair removal,\" Fahs said in a phone interview. \"Over the years, those who have taken part in it have shared quite consistent issues: a deep sense of shame, struggle with self-confidence, even social ostracism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There have also been cases of heterosexism and homophobia -- this idea that growing your leg hair automatically implies you\\'re queer, or shaving it means you\\'re a gay man. Women often don\\'t realize how much society, family and friends weigh in on what we do with our bodies. And how much of what we think is a choice -- that \\'I choose to shave\\' -- has actually been imparted to and enforced upon us for generations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fahs also saw feelings of empowerment, rebellion and anger stirring from the project. \"Particularly in the last two years, in the wake of the election and the #MeToo movement -- there\\'s been a deeper awareness of the restrictions surrounding women\\'s bodies, of feminism, gender and sexuality, and a willingness to push back against it all, or at least break out of the comfort zone,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not just Fahs\\' students.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new cohort of young women is embracing body hair, especially on Instagram. The phenomenon has also made it into magazines. In the September issue of Harper\\'s Bazaar, actress Emily Ratajkowski posed with unshaven underarms (a full 360-degree turn for the publication since its early anti-armpit hair messages). YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen and musician Halsey have also showed off their body hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewly launched women\\'s shaving brands are also making a case for female fuzz, and encouraging positive conversations around the topic. The Flamingo razor, from the popular grooming line Harry\\'s, emphasizes the right to choose whether to shave with ad slogans like \"No Waxation Without Representation\" and \"We Are Grow Choice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ned diverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness. Direct-to-consumer razor start-up Billie , established in 2017, is another company that\\'s marketing the idea of choice. Rather than showing the perfectly smooth models typical of female shaving ads, its campaigns depictdiverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For so long, advertising has only reinforced the taboo around the subject,\" said Billie co-founder Georgina Gooley in a phone interview. \"We wanted to actually acknowledge that women have body hair, show it, and say that shaving is a choice. If you want to keep your body hair, we celebrate that. And if you want to remove it, that\\'s fine as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotographer Ashley Armitage, who worked on the Billie campaigns and artfully depicts body hair on her Instagram account , agrees. \"Body hair is a personal choice,\" she wrote in an email. \"Shaving it, waxing it, or growing it are all valid options, and all up to the individual.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that not shaving can be a choice may not seem revolutionary, when it comes to normalizing body hair. But it could be an important step towards reframing the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think more women are realizing how body hair is deeply connected to gender and power,\" said Fahs. \"The emotional nature of what body hair elicits in people has tremendous potential as a tool for activism and social change.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTop image: Lady Gaga performs at the 22nd Annual MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto, Canada on June 19, 2011.',\n",

The soldiers\\' strong bodies and minds are touted as the ultimate male virtues, along with their fierce loyalty to the party -- qualities that some say Xi eagerly wants to promote as he vows to lead China into a great \"national rejuvenation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPropaganda poster decpits a People\\'s Liberation Army soldier holding Mao Zedong\\'s \"Little Red Book.\" Credit: GraphicaArtis/Archive Photos/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first three decades of Communist rule, artistic depictions of Chinese men were dominated by heroic portrayals of PLA soldiers and, to a lesser degree, farmers and industrial workers -- two pillars of the proletariat class.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some of the genre\\'s works were created with ink, in a traditional Chinese style, the majority comprised neoclassical oil paintings or watercolors by artists who either studied overseas or were influenced by Western trends, according to You Yang, deputy director of the Beijing-based UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeoclassical art, which traces its origin to ancient Greece and Rome though it rose to prominence in 19th-century Europe, is known to feature male protagonists with accentuated muscles striking gallant poses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1949, Mao made it clear that \"all artwork must reflect the leadership of the Party and the will of the state,\" said You, explaining that neoclassicism found fertile ground in Communist societies -- first the Soviet Union and then China -- where artists used the style to fulfill their political duty of worshipping war heroes or strongman leaders.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeijing residents pass by a huge poster depicting two workers and one soldier.

In paintings, as well as on stage and on screen, all protagonists -- who were almost always men -- had to be \"red and bright\" to highlight their revolutionary credentials and heroism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was an inevitably politicized masculinity, said You, represented by military men with sharp jawlines and muscular arms. Throwing their clenched fists into the air as they vowed to defeat the enemy, these heroes were devoid of any hint of sexuality, in line with the party\\'s puritanical moral code.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Chinese Cultural Revolution poster encourages people to exercise in the \"big ocean,\" a metaphor for a large challenge.

Like South Korean K-pop stars, they boast slender figures and often wear cutesy expressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a report released early this year, the online shopping platform of Chinese tech giant Alibaba found sales of men\\'s cosmetic products jumped more than 50% in 2018, naming the popularity of \"pretty boys\" as a reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after a period of social liberalization in the post-Mao era, there are signs that Xi\\'s government is beginning to turn against male role models deemed too effeminate. A widely cited commentary , published last year by state-run Xinhua news agency, said: \"Whether a country embraces or rejects (effeminate men) is ... a grave matter that affects the nation\\'s future.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nActor and singer Lu Han performs at a New Year\\'s countdown party in 2016 in Shenzhen, China. Credit: VCG/Visual China Group/Visual China Group via Getty Ima\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing its ire on wildly popular male idols, the article blasted the \"sickly aesthetics\" that had propelled \"gender-ambiguous, heavily made-up, tall and delicate\" young men to stardom on television and online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The phenomenon of \\'sissy men\\' has caused a public backlash because the impact of such sickly culture on the youth cannot be underestimated,\" it said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When critics say \\'sissy young men turn a nation sissy,\\' they may sound somewhat facetious,\" it added. \"(But) nurturing a new generation that could rejuvenate the nation requires the resistance of erosive unhealthy culture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Xinhua\\'s lead, other Chinese media outlets have published blistering editorials and commentaries criticizing male celebrities who appear effeminate.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoy Wang Yuan of TFBoys performs his first solo concert at the Nanjing Olympic Sports Center in August 2019. Credit: VCG/Visual China Group/VCG via Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have also been user-generated online campaigns calling for some celebrities to be banished from the country\\'s airwaves and internet platforms because of how they look. The government also seems to be tightening restrictions on what is seen on screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this year, China\\'s major video-streaming platforms began censoring male actors\\' earrings, blurring their earlobes. Incidentally, the ban came after censors prohibited the depiction of same-sex relationships on television and online, along with a wide range of what China calls \"vulgar, immoral and unhealthy content\" that also includes incest and one-night stands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome targeted celebrities, including TFBoys, have responded to critics by ditching cosmetics and flowery wardrobes in favor of showing toned muscles in photo shoots.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother trend has been the launch of a growing number of so-called \"masculinity programs\" aimed at instilling traditional gender roles in boys and young men through outdoor sports and classroom training. Last year, one such club in Beijing attracted attention -- and some criticism -- for having its students run shirtless in the dead of winter. \"There is a crisis in boys\\' education and I threw myself into practical actions to save them and help them find their lost masculinity,\" the Boys\\' Club founder told the South China Morning Post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Sissy men\\' are under attack because they are perceived to be challenging the traditional notion of manliness,\" said Fang Gang, an associate professor at Beijing Forestry University whose research focuses on gender studies and sex education.\\r\\n\\r\\nFang points out that, ironically, the current controversy is partly due to recent progress made by sexual minorities in China. Activists say a nascent but increasingly visible LGBTQ rights movement is slowly changing hearts and minds, encouraging greater social acceptance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some parents extend their worries about perceived gender-neutral appearances by linking it to homosexuality,\" he said. \"Greater social acceptance of the gay community has only deepened fears among homophobic people, making them more anxious and afraid of non-mainstream masculinity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers suspect a more direct link between the crackdown on \"sissy men\" and top officials\\' worldviews, which for many were shaped during the Cultural Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strongman\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Xi\\'s attitude towards masculinity may trace back to his youth, which, from the late 1960s to mid-1970s, was spent in the Chinese countryside along with as many as 17 million other high school students and graduates. They were part of the \"sent-down\" generation relocated to the country\\'s far-flung corners to learn agricultural and political lessons from poverty-stricken peasants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the summer, I was almost sleeping in a pile of fleas -- all the bites and subsequent scratching turned my whole body swollen,\" he wrote in 2002. \"But after two years, I became used to it and could sleep through the night no matter how much I got bitten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese men in military uniforms reading from Mao\\'s \"Little Red Book\" before starting their day. Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese leader\\'s definition of manliness also has a political dimension. During a meeting with officials in southern China just months after taking power, Xi reportedly lamented the lack of strong convictions among Soviet communists when their party was on the verge of collapse. He was widely quoted by overseas Chinese-language media as saying that: \"In the end nobody was a real man, nobody came out to resist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nXi\\'s government seems determined to resist the perceived feminization of Chinese men through regulations and propaganda.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a sign of a tightened political environment, artist Ming was reluctant to acknowledge the sensitivity of his art, which includes an almost-naked portrayal of the iconic PLA soldier from the Cultural Revolution-era opera \"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strength is needed -- with muscles -- for militaries, revolutions and the proletariat, which means manual labor,\" said Ming. \"But in traditional Chinese art and literature, male beauty is about being delicate, pale and pretty,\" he added, pointing to a contradiction in the way men have been depicted through history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I paint from a Chinese perspective -- and my work is on a continuum of Chinese aesthetics,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now, Ming\\'s website remains blocked in China and the artist doesn\\'t foresee his work being exhibited in his home country anytime soon. The cultural tradition that inspired him appears increasingly incompatible with the muscular strength appreciated and projected by the Chinese leader at home and abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tiger Mountain\" by Musk Ming.

       " 'Written by Jorge Grimberg, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, the Brazilian fashion industry made global headlines. Donata Meirelles , then fashion director at Vogue Brazil, was celebrating her 50th birthday in the predominantly black city of Salvador, Bahia. During the celebration, journalist Fabio Bernardo snapped a photo of Meirelles, who is white, sitting in a traditional throne-like chair flanked by two baianas (Afro-Brazilian women wearing white lace gowns and headpieces), which he then shared on Instagram.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many who saw the post (which has since been deleted), the scene evoked colonial Brazil, when white elites ruled over black slaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What happened there is what happens in this country built on racism, bodies, sweat, blood and black tears,\" Afro-Brazilian actress and activist Tais Araujo, Vogue Brazil\\'s November 2018 cover star, posted to her Instagram account in the days following the event. \"This suffering is so naturalized that it is difficult for people who do not identify with the girls standing by the chair to feel what the black population feels. Everything becomes natural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the party was not an official Vogue event, the backlash was enough to warrant Meirelles\\' resignation from the title just a few days after the event, and a public apology from the magazine, who wrote on Instagram that they hoped the discussions sparked by the incident had \"served as a learning opportunity.\" (Both Meirelles and Vogue Brazil declined to be interviewed for this story.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Vogue Brazil fashion director Donata Meirelles in 2016. Credit: Fernanda Calfat/Getty Images South America/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it has: On social media and beyond, the industry and the public have been having long overdue conversations about race and representation in Brazil\\'s fashion community.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics study released in 2016, 54% of Brazilians identify as black or multiracial. And yet black people have been all but erased from the mainstream fashion industry -- in front of the camera, on the catwalk and behind the scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, model diversity at SÃ£o Paulo Fashion Week has been so low that in 2009, following intense pressure from anti-racism activists and state prosecutors, the organizing body mandated that 10% of models in each show must be black.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last edition of SÃ£o Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), which took place in April month, black models were still in the minority, and for the last three seasons, only one black designer -- Luiz Claudio of Apartamento 03 -- has participated. (SPFW CEO Paulo Borges told CNN that organizers are aware of the disparity and are discussing ways to bring in new players.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy model Leomie Anderson is fighting for change\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In a country where most of the population is black, it\\'s troubling to think that fashion, one of the most important vehicles of cultural and social expression, excludes such large numbers of creators and consumers,\" Afro-Brazilian artist and fashion designer Carol Barreto, who teaches gender studies at the Federal University of Bahia, said in an email.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The entertainment world is highly susceptible to reproducing stereotypes, so it\\'s important to study the limits and latitudes imposed when dealing with questions of race,\" she continued, because the propagation of negative images can contribute to perceptions of Black people as inferior.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuliano Corbetta, founder and editor-in-chief of the online menswear publication Made in Brazil, has witnessed how racial inequality in Brazil can affect a magazine financially.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2018, Corbetta set out to publish an issue that was would feature predominantly black talent (including producers, photographers and models) to inspire \"16-year-old kids dreaming of breaking into a fashion career.\" Though he had no trouble finding talent to fill the pages, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to secure the advertisements needed to fund the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Reality hit. For the first time in nine years in publishing, everyone declined. No one wanted to include this (magazine) in their 2019 plans,\" Corbetta said. Many brands, he claims, told him an all-black issue wouldn\\'t resonate with their audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe connects the issue to the fact that, in Brazil, discussing race and racism is still widely taboo. \"We never talk about apartheid. We didn\\'t have a Martin Luther King. We didn\\'t have a Rosa Parks. We didn\\'t have an actual militant anti-racism movement. We have never talked about prejudice, even though it exists, so brands don\\'t talk about it either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this landscape, Brazil\\'s black creatives -- like many marginalized groups around the world -- are increasingly turning to the internet and social media to create spaces for themselves in response to a lack of mainstream opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nRio de Janeiro-based Luiza Brazil, an influencer and writer, has built her personal and professional brand online. Credit: Courtesy Luiza Brasil\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the route taken by Luiza Brasil, a Rio de Janeiro-based influencer and columnist for the Brazilian edition of Glamour. In 2015, she created Mequetrefismos, an online fashion, beauty and lifestyle publication, to promote the work of black people working within those fields; and, as a curator for the Casa Ipanema lifestyle boutique in Rio, has brought brands runs by black women to the forefront.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We see more black people featured on magazine covers and in advertisements for luxury stores, but who are the people behind these campaigns? (The fact that they are usually white) says a lot about the lack of black people in organizations and leadership roles,\" Brasil said in a WhatsApp message. \"The black population is in the majority -- at 54% -- but our narratives have always been constructed by white people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think the Afro-Brazilian (empowerment) movement has always existed, but it\\'s always been invisible. With the help of the internet, the Afro-Brazilian movement has gained momentum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKevin David, a 25-year-old based in SÃ£o Paulo, agrees. As executive creative director of MOOC , a Black-run creative collective, he\\'s used the power of social media to land youth-oriented collaborative campaigns with the likes of Levi\\'s, Converse, GQ Brazil and Schutz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are fewer opportunities (for black creatives), but we are taking over. We have entered the market ... Weren\\'t happy with the way the market was treating us,\" David said. \"We didn\\'t want anyone else to tell our story. We wanted to take action and show that we believe representation means at this moment in Brazil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrasil believes that the ongoing empowerment black creatives in the digital sphere will help challenge existing narratives and give Brazil more complex, diverse representations of black identity -- within Afro-Brazilian communities and in the mainstream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We no longer only represent an image of the ghetto, of blacks speaking only to blacks, but an important snapshot of society and our media in general\", she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop image: Models backstage at the Apartamento 03 fashion show during Sao Paulo Fashion Week in April 2019.',\n",

Definitive figures are difficult to determine because there isn\\'t a shared definition of what constitutes a \"luxury item\" and due to the surreptitious way North Korea imports such items.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mercedes-Maybach S600, however, is undoubtedly luxurious. It\\'s equipped with leather massaging seats and armor to protect occupants from steel-core ammo fired from assault rifles and from explosive devices, according to Car and Driver.\\r\\n\\r\\nKim is usually seen being chauffeured in what\\'s believed to be a Mercedes-Maybach Pullman Guard armored limousine, which carries a price tag upwards of $1 million. It\\'s believed that was the vehicle his security escort ran alongside of during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nKim was also spotted with a Rolls-Royce last year\\r\\n\\r\\nDaimler, the company that owns Mercedes, told CNN it \"has no indication on how the mentioned vehicles were delivered and where they come from.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and US embargoes.

Shortly after the DN5505 left South Korea, it reported via its AIS system -- a way to locate ships at sea -- that its intended destination was the Russian city of Nakhodka, where it was estimated to arrive on October 5, according to C4ADS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rear exterior of a Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Guard.

       " 'Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, ground was broken on a grand new hotel in North Korea\\'s capital, Pyongyang. The pyramid-shaped, supertall skyscraper was to exceed 1,000 feet in height, and was designed to house at least 3,000 rooms, as well as five revolving restaurants with panoramic views.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ryugyong Hotel -- named after a historical moniker for Pyongyang meaning \"capital of willows\" -- was supposed to open just two years later. But it never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the structure reached its planned height in 1992, it stood windowless and hollow for another 16 years, its naked concrete exposed, like a menacing monster overlooking the city. During that time the building, which dwarfs everything around it, earned itself the nickname \"Hotel of Doom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hotel has since been clad in metal and glass, and was later fitted with LED lights to turn it into a colorful nighttime spectacle. Construction work has started and stopped many times, fueling constant speculation over whether it will ever open to guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill closed to this day, the Ryugyong Hotel is the world\\'s tallest unoccupied building.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ryugyong Hotel in 2018. Credit: ED JONES/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nA Cold War pawn\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ryugyong Hotel was a product of the Cold War rivalry between US-supported South Korea and the Soviet-backed North. The year before construction commenced, a South Korean firm had built what was then the world\\'s tallest hotel, the Westin Stamford in Singapore. The South\\'s capital Seoul was meanwhile getting ready to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, with the country transitioning to a capitalist democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of North Korea\\'s political response to the South\\'s achievements, Pyongyang organized the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students, a sort of socialist version of the Olympics. The country planned to build the massive hotel just in time for the event, stealing the world record away from the South.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut due to engineering problems it wasn\\'t finished in time for the festival. The government had already poured billions into the event, building a new stadium, expanding Pyongyang\\'s airport and paving new roads. That put a strain on the hermit state\\'s frail economy, while the Soviet Union\\'s collapse left it deprived of vital aid and investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Korea was bound for an economic crisis. Although the external structure had been completed, construction was halted in 1992 and a crane was abandoned on top of the building.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ryugyong Hotel in 2008. Credit: Eric Lafforgue/Art in All of Us/Corbis/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nA concrete structure\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building consists of three wings, each sloped at a 75-degree angle, converging into a cone encasing the top 15 floors, which are intended for restaurants and observation decks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pyramidal shape is about more than aesthetics -- it\\'s because the Ryugyong, unusually for a skyscraper, is made of reinforced concrete rather than steel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was built like this because the upper levels needed to be lighter,\" said Calvin Chua, a Singapore-based architect who has extensively researched Pyongyang\\'s urbanism, in a phone interview. \"They didn\\'t have advanced construction materials, so it was built entirely in concrete. You can\\'t achieve a slender tower that way, you need to have a massive base with a tapered top.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you look at the history of construction in North Korea since the end of the Korean War, most of the buildings are made of concrete: That\\'s the material that they are familiar with, and the technology transfer between Soviet or communist states is purely based around concrete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of a Socialist Women\\'s Union propaganda troupe perform a dance in front of the Ryugyong hotel in 2019. Credit: ED JONES/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Chua, who has worked in North Korea with local architects, the Ryugyong may have been designed to look like a mountain, not a pyramid, because mountains play an important role in the country\\'s symbolism. The official biography of Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of current ruler Kim Jong Un, states that he was born in a secret military camp on Mount Paektu, the tallest mountain in the Korean peninsula that is depicted in the national emblem of North Korea. (Many historians believe Kim Jong Il was actually born in Russia.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a very iconic building, but I think it\\'s important to consider where it sits in relation to the entire city fabric of Pyongyang,\" said Chua. \"It\\'s like a sort of obelisk. If you think of the obelisk in Rome\\'s St. Peter\\'s Square, it provides a [beacon] for the city apart from its symbolism. The Ryugyong is similar, but it\\'s also more symbolically defined.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA second start\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, after a 16-year pause, construction unexpectedly resumed, as part of a deal with Orascom, an Egyptian conglomerate that was contracted to build North Korea\\'s 3G network.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rusty old crane that had stood atop the building for two decades was finally removed . Workers aided by Egyptian engineers installed glass and metal panels to the concrete structure at the cost of $180 million, glazing it completely and giving the building a polished, sleek appearance. The project, completed in 2011, fueled speculation about the hotel\\'s opening. In late 2012, German luxury hotel group Kempinski announced that the Ryugyong would partially open under its management in mid-2013, but then pulled out a few months later, stating that entering the market was \"not currently possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cladding of the concrete shell. Credit: Eric Lafforgue/Art in All of Us/Corbis/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-standing rumors that the building was structurally unsound due to poor construction techniques and materials gained strength once again. In 2014, a 23-story apartment building collapsed in Pyongyang because construction was \"not done properly,\" according to North Korean state media reports.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Judging from the exterior, the building looks structurally sound, although the interior may be a different story,\" said Chua. \"I think the real problem might be the ease of fitting it out, because it was built with concrete and it would take a lot of time to rewire the necessary services and ventilation systems that were originally created to 1980s specifications. That would be much easier with a steel structure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotographs of the hotel\\'s interior from 2012 revealed that, inside, very little work had been done. The images were taken by Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Group, a Beijing-based company specializing in North Korea tours, and one of the very few foreigners to have been inside the Ryugyong Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lobby of the Ryugyong Hotel in 2012. Credit: Simon Cockerell / Koryo Group\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was arranged through a Korean connection as a birthday gift for me,\" he said in a phone interview. \"First of all, we had a presentation from the director of the site, with videos made quite a long time ago. Then they took us into the lobby area, where there was a lot of exposed cement. Then we went (on) the one working elevator to the top, which was the 99th floor, I believe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It took a long time to get there, because it was a service elevator, not a modern lift with a string of buttons. There was a lift operator who determined where to stop. At the top we had a look around, took some pictures and went back down to the lobby again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough its external appearance had been transformed, the Ryugyong still wasn\\'t open.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brighter future?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ryugyong came back to life in 2018, when LEDs were installed on its facade, turning the building into Pyonyang\\'s biggest light show -- as well as a propaganda machine. A four-minute program shows North Korea\\'s history and a variety of political slogans, while the cone at the top projects a huge North Korean flag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s really striking the first time you see it, especially after so many years of the building sitting there in darkness,\" said Will Ripley, a CNN correspondent who has taken multiple trips to Pyongyang, in an email. \"I know they turn it on whenever there are major events in the city, but it\\'s not on all the time -- I would assume to save scarce electricity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light show in 2018. Credit: ED JONES/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, extensive work has been carried out on the site surrounding the hotel, which was recently opened up, making it possible for anyone to walk right up to the front entrance (but not get in). In June 2018, a sign was added to the building, reading simply \"The Ryugyong Hotel\" in Korean and English.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question remains: Will it ever open? \"It\\'s very hard to say, because since the building was clad in glass, you can\\'t see inside,\" said Cockerell. \"No doubt something\\'s going on. It\\'s a very large building. It\\'s not inconceivable that some part of it may open before the whole of it could open.

       " 'Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2017 at Christie\\'s New York, Alex Rotter uttered a phrase never before heard at an art auction: \"Four hundred million.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis bid was in dollars, and the lot in question was the last known Leonardo da Vinci painting in private hands. Audible gasps gave way to applause, and, less than a minute later, the gavel fell to make history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter fees, the \"Salvator Mundi\" sold for $450.3 million , obliterating auction records for a work of art.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it wasn\\'t Rotter who made the world-famous purchase -- it was the anonymous bidder on the end of his telephone line. In fact, he was just as surprised as anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought when we reached $200 million it would end,\" he recalled to CNN on the phone. \"Then I thought it would end when we reached $300 million... a natural stopping point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was really unclear how far the client would go. It was just (me saying), \\'Do you want to?\\' I remember making sure that I -- that he -- was very clear about the bidding increments and what the next bid was.\\r\\n\\r\\nRotter (far right) during the sale of the \"Salvator Mundi\" at Christie\\'s New York. Credit: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Normally I\\'d just say the next bid, but I remember clarifying it at 300 million. I said, \\'It\\'s $300 million, do you want to bid $300 million now?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At this level you can\\'t mess up -- you can\\'t (get it) wrong,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a remarkably candid account, given how tight-lipped Christie\\'s has remained about the historic sale. The auction house has consistently refused to discuss the bidder\\'s identity, though it is widely believed to have been Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, acting on behalf of the kingdom\\'s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, better known as MbS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"Salvator Mundi\" sold for $450 million.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had no recollection of time -- you could have told me it was two minutes,\" Rotter said of the 18-minute bidding war, adding: \"(It) was one of the most exciting moments that I\\'ve experienced in my 20 years of auctions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArt world matchmaker\\r\\n\\r\\nAustrian-born Rotter, Christie\\'s chairman of post-war and contemporary art, wouldn\\'t be drawn on further details. But his recollections of other record-breaking sales paint a compelling picture of high drama and pressured decision-making.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis auction day role -- which the 45-year-old admits is \"quite stressful\" -- sees him telling telephone bidders what\\'s happening in the room. This means relaying the auctioneer\\'s words and price increments in real-time, as well as communicating details about potential rivals (revealing the identity of other phone bidders is, however, \"a big no-no,\" Rotter stressed).\\r\\n\\r\\nAgents celebrate after the auction of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"Salvator Mundi\" during the Post-War and Contemporary Art evening sale at Christie\\'s on November 15, 2017. Rotter is pictured on the right. Credit: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of Rotter\\'s interlocutors are long-term clients. So he\\'s also on hand to offer advice -- how much similar artworks sold for, or how a bidding war might unfold. And then, by Rotter\\'s own admission, there\\'s an element of gentle encouragement. Auctioneering is a commissions business, after all (and the so-called \"buyer\\'s premium\" at Christie\\'s ranges from about 13% to 30% of the winning bid).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat might surprise those outside the art world, however, is that his wealthy clients don\\'t always have a maximum price in mind -- even when it comes to multimillion-dollar paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard people on the telephone say, \\'Alex, let\\'s just buy it, no matter how far it goes,\\' and I\\'ve heard people (say), \\'I have a limit, and don\\'t even ask me if we reach (it) because I don\\'t want to be tempted,\\'\" revealed Rotter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People have different strategies for how to go about it. I do think people get carried away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Competition attracts everyone, and on auction night, you\\'re in the bidding process and it\\'s a little bit of a race. People don\\'t like to lose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, Rotter has become a familiar sight in the so-called \"phone bank,\" the line of well-heeled go-betweens covering their mouths as they confer with anonymous buyers. Last November, he made another world record bid -- this time on behalf of an unidentified client pursuing David Hockney\\'s \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures).\" At $90.3 million, the sale marked the highest sum ever paid for the work of a living artist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rabbit,\" by Jeff Koons, is now the most expensive artwork by a living artist to ever sell at auction. Credit: Courtesy Christie\\'s\\r\\n\\r\\nThis record was broken again, just six months later, by Jeff Koons\\' $91.1-million \"Rabbit\" sculpture. And although Rotter wasn\\'t on the winning client\\'s side this time, he was nonetheless instrumental in bringing the artwork to auction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, despite his public-facing role, most of the Austrian\\'s work happens in the weeks and months prior to a sale. As well as conceiving of auction themes and populating them with relevant works, he serves as something of an art-world matchmaker, filling gaps in collectors\\' portfolios and tracking down the world\\'s most sought-after paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Dream of big numbers\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIdentifying targets means knowing art intimately -- and seeing lots of it too. The journey to bring Koons\\' \"Rabbit\" to auction began with Rotter\\'s personal encounter with the sculpture at the Newhouse Apartment gallery in New York at the beginning of the last decade: \"I remember saying to my colleagues, \\'one day...\\'\" he recalled.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven at the highest echelons of the art market, such instincts outweigh number-crunching. Data \"substantiates the intuition and gut feeling experts have,\" Rotter said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHailing from a family of Austrian art dealers, these instincts are, undoubtedly, finely tuned. He made his first sale, aged 13, at his mother\\'s booth at a Vienna art and antiques fair, where he sold an early 19th-century porcelain cup and saucer for the equivalent of $1,000, and a watercolor by Austrian painter Rudolf von Alt for 10 times that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlex Rotter moved to Christie\\'s from rival auction house, Sotheby\\'s, in 2016. Credit: Ilya S. Savenok/Getty\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother had to help in the final round of negotiation as I didn\\'t want to give more than a 10% discount and the guy insisted on more,\" he recalled. \"But I remember the feeling of closing a sale and it had me hooked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty years on, closing deals is still the endgame. When desired artworks are identified, it\\'s often Rotter\\'s job to convince their owners to part company with them. Such discussions involve not only an item\\'s valuation, but negotiations over fees and the size of the opening bid (\"In an ideal world, you start lower than you think it would make, and then have it run\").\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the aforementioned Hockney painting, whose owner Christie\\'s courted for a year and a half, it was a case of making them \"dream of big numbers,\" as Rotter recalled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People who own $80 million paintings are (going) to be savvy and smart. They didn\\'t just sign on the dotted line. They made it competitive. So, after us, they also went to the other auction houses and asked them for opinions, values, pitches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was some price resistance,\" he added, \"Hockney\\'s world record (at the time) was $25 million, and here was a painting that was expected to sell for $80 million.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Hockney\\'s \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures).\" Credit: Courtesy Christie\\'s\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while Rotter estimates that bidding usually starts between 30% and 50% of the expected price, the Hockney auction opened low, at just $20 million -- a quarter of Christie\\'s top estimate. The gamble paid off, as bids soared past $90 million.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the end of the day, we got our result by starting low and tempting (bidders) ... so it worked out beautifully.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarket pressures\\r\\n\\r\\nWith collectors increasingly shopping for art on Instagram and looking beyond Western marketplaces for returns, there are plenty of challenges facing European auction houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July, research firm ArtTactic reported that Christie\\'s, Sotheby\\'s and Phillips had posted a collective 20.3% year-on-year drop in sales in the first half of 2019. Indeed, if it weren\\'t for the $450 million auction of the \"Salvator Mundi\" in 2017, and Peggy and David Rockefeller\\'s huge $832 million private art collection in 2018, then both of these years might have been considered disappointing for Christie\\'s, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis recent dip may not concern an auction market known for its volatility. For all the ups and downs of the last decade, global auction sales in 2018 were, at $29.1 billion, slightly above 2008 levels, according to Art Basel and UBS\\' authoritative Global Art Market Report\\r\\n\\r\\nBut sales of art and antiques online -- whether from auction houses\\' websites or internet retailers -- have exploded, almost doubling between 2013 and 2018. Online transactions may represent a small chunk of the art market, at $6 billion, but growth looks set to continue. Generation Z collectors are more than twice as likely than their millennial or generation X counterparts to prefer buying art on the internet, the same report found.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated video: Former Christie\\'s CEO Steven Murphy explains how art auctions work\\r\\n\\r\\nWith their wood-paneled rooms, corded telephones and paper catalogs, the old auction houses of New York and London appear increasingly antiquated. Nonetheless, Christie\\'s is adapting to the digital age -- more than 250 years after its founding. Last year, it hosted 88 web-only auctions, and generated online sales of $250 million (up by more than 16% from 2016, the year Rotter arrived from arch rival Sotheby\\'s).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s still a brick-and-mortar business. But Rotter is confident that his employer -- now owned by French billionaire FranÃ§ois Pinault -- can use heritage to its advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is obviously something very traditional, something charming about (auctions) -- that it\\'s still wooden benches (and) telephones,\" he said. \"There\\'s obviously a digital technology revolution going on in the auction business. A lot of the transactions happen online now. (But) the spectacle of the evening sale stays the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People like to dress up; they like to come to the auction or to participate in it somehow,\" he added. \"It\\'s serious art we\\'re selling, but it\\'s still an event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, he depicts big-ticket auctions as being uniquely democratic -- great levelers through which an artwork\\'s market value emerges in real-time. Or as Rotter put it: \"Who bids the most gets the painting. There\\'s no trickery, there\\'s no advantage for someone who comes first or has a bigger name. That\\'s the beauty of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phone bank, pictured during the sale of David Hockney\\'s \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures).\" Credit: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to the art itself, however, bigger names command bigger prices. So which painting is the holy grail of the market -- the one artwork his clients all want but can\\'t have?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are a handful of objects,\" Rotter said. \"I\\'m not talking about pieces that are hanging in MoMA or the Metropolitan Museum, because they will never be obtainable. But there is (always) one object that still sits in a private collection -- this one Van Gogh, this one Warhol, this one Koons -- that everyone wants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obviously, I have this list in my office. It lives there -- I know it by heart -- with little thumbnail images.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You always try,\" he concluded, adding: \"Always shoot for the masterpieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTop image caption: Rotter (right) confers with a telephone bidder.',\n",
       " 'Written by Aileen Kwun, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNN Stephy Chung, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide \"momentum\" for its \"existing diversity and inclusion approach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe move marked Chanel\\'s entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to \"create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity.\" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry\\'s response to accusations that it\\'s out of touch with customers and society at large.\\r\\n\\r\\nFashion brand Burberry apologized for showcasing a hoodie that featured a noose around the neck during its show at London Fashion Week. Credit: REX/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nThese missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry\\'s noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci\\'s turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G\\'s ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion\\'s troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeen Vogue\\'s fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , \"why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother user wrote: \"white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn\\'t a POC @CHANEL.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter\\'s appointment \"is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?\\r\\n\\r\\nFashion\\'s new watchdogs\\r\\n\\r\\nWith designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nFashion\\'s watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million \"Dieters\") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G\\'s self-inflicted woes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, \"and in the 1920s and \\'30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown\" in marketing materials. \"It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw \"coolie\" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior\\'s \"New Look\" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nA model wears the popular bar suit by Christian Dior. The press dubbed Dior\\'s first collection, \"New Look.\" Credit: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nSales of the YSL perfume \"Opium\" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent\\'s name, which many felt trivialized China\\'s painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,\" Steele said in a phone interview. \"How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G\\'s ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It\\'s absolutely absurd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana\\'s alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,\" Steele added. \"Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy brands miss the mark\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as \"creepy\" by social media users.\\r\\n\\r\\nFashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Dolce & Gabbana ad sparked controversy after it depicted an Asian model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks. Credit: Dolce & Gabbana\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like ChloÃ©, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what\\'s going on globally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With China and Western countries, there\\'s a big gap,\" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. \"Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That\\'s something most people outside of China wouldn\\'t understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences\\' cultures. She cited the HermÃ¨s-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country\\'s traditional craftsmanship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than money\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is clearly no shortage of money at Europe\\'s biggest fashion houses, and China\\'s rise as the world\\'s fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience\\'s culture isn\\'t a matter of money, according to Steele.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolce & Gabbana forced to cancel show in China\\r\\n\\r\\nIf more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. \"Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn\\'t enough,\" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and \"in a position that isn\\'t threatened or penalized for speaking up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,\" she said. \"You really have to have diversity in terms of who\\'s in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSteele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion\\'s upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands\\' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.\\r\\n\\r\\nGucci came under fire for retailing a $790 turban, a garment with religious significance for Sikhs. Credit: FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the industry\\'s problematic lack of diversity isn\\'t just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you\\'re getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,\" said Steele.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,\" she said in a phone interview. \"In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSteps toward accountability\\r\\n\\r\\nBrands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country\\'s diversity in its workforce across all levels,\" the briefing stated. \"It\\'s crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the report articulated, diversity is \"simply a measure of difference\" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating \"a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole.\" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrada came under fire for producing merchandise resembling blackface caricatures. Credit: Courtesy Chinyere Ezie\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion\\'s ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America\\'s (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemedies will take time, and the CFDA\\'s report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada\\'s blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will \"elevate voices of color.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund \"to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBurberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry\\'s wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of publication, D&G, Dior and Saint Laurent had not responded to CNN\\'s request for comment.',\n",

Cartoonists, get arrested, put in jail everywhere because of the medium.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons\\' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Using satire and humor is effective because it breaks the fear barrier,\" he said in a phone interview.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People had always been afraid to speak out. The culture of fear is always there; the culture of self-censorship is always there. That\\'s where satire and humor can be the most effective tool, it makes people less afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCartoonist\\'s muse\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a number of false starts, Zunar\\'s career as a political cartoonist was flagging when his nemesis emerged on the political scene in the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Najoib\\'s wife Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Credit: Zunar\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many ways, the artist\\'s career trajectory rose in tandem with that of Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers who climbed quickly through the ranks of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, initially as deputy prime minister and then to the premiership itself in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Najib\\'s star grew, so did the frustration of his critics. Detractors delighted in seeing him brought back down to Earth by Zunar\\'s increasingly exaggerated, grotesque portrayals.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore even than Najib however, Zunar found his muse in Rosmah. He did, however, face more difficulty publishing cartoons of her, versus those of the Prime Minister.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosmah Mansor, the wife of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, arrives at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in Putrajaya on September 26, 2018.

When Rosmah was the subject however, \"the police came and stopped the launch ... (from this) we can understand that maybe that she is more powerful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When police raided the couple\\'s properties in Kuala Lumpur last year, they seized jewelry and gemstones worth over $109 million. Around $13 million worth of HermÃ¨s handbags were also confiscated, along with cash and other goods totaling over $100 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the items were, allegedly, purchased with money embezzled from the 1MDB state investment fund, set up by Najib. Rosmah has pleaded not guilty, and due to numerous delays in the legal system, has yet to end up in court.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1MDB scandal -- and Rosmah\\'s spending -- became a central theme of Zunar\\'s work. In particular, the artist sought to make a connection between the allegedly embezzled funds and the Malaysian people: One cartoon showed Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal\\'s waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Zunar\\'s cartoons show Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal\\'s waste.

Using a combination of journalism and art, Zunar highlighted the instances where this was not the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut doing so would ultimately endanger his freedom, as Najib\\'s government took a hard authoritarian turn in an attempt to stifle criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nClowning around\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2010, Zunar was questioned multiple times under the Sedition Act , a colonial-era law widely denounced by human rights groups as draconian.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, he was charged with taking actions deemed \"detrimental to parliamentary democracy\" over a series of cartoons depicting government corruption. Police seized hundreds of his books, and unknown assailants attacked him at an exhibition.\\r\\n\\r\\nA collection of Zunar\\'s books seen on sale in a Kuala Lumpur shopping mall in February 2019.

The ban, according to free-speech group IFEX, \"appear(ed) to be an attempt to damp down the growing international publicity (surrounding) Zunar and his work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZunar was not the only artist to face blowback for satirizing Najib. In June 2016, Fahmi Reza was charged with two counts of violating section 233(1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, which forbids disseminating online content deemed to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFahmi had depicted Najib as a clown with big red lips and arched, thick eyebrows.

In 2004 , he designed a poster for a demonstration against police brutality, and volunteered to help print and distribute leaflets and other materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately for him, Fahmi\\'s conscientiousness was his downfall. Arriving ahead of most other protesters, police saw him with a large number of posters and banners.

Protesters also delighted in using the caricatures of Najib and Rosmah on posters and placards after it was revealed how much the artists had irritated them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Malaysia\\'s opposition grew ever more determined to oust Najib -- with many observers warning that 2016\\'s general election might be their last chance to do so -- the government passed new legislation to control what people could say about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivists hold up caricatures of Najib Razak and Rosmah Mansor (center).

Even though the electoral map was redrawn in his favor, he lost heavily. With an 82.32% turnout, an opposition coalition led by current Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad took 121 of 222 seats. Najib\\'s Barisan Nasional coalition won just 79.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncertain future\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Najib\\'s downfall, charges against Zunar and Fahmi have been dropped, though the latter is still fighting to have an earlier conviction overturned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth men said that, while they felt considerably freer under the new government, true reform has yet to be delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\nZunar has faced considerable restrictions on his work in the past, struggling against Malaysia\\'s laws on speech and expression.

       " 'Written by Jessica Rapp, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nFor decades, padded push-up bras, lace-lined bodysuits and slim, voluptuous Victoria\\'s Secret models have shaped public perceptions of what \"sexy\" looks like. But a growing number of lingerie brands are responding to discontent from consumers who want to see themselves better represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom offering a wider range of cup sizes and \"nude\" shades, to celebrating diversity in campaigns and on runways, intimate apparel labels are selling more than bras. They\\'re selling inclusivity, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLingerie is set to become a $59 billion market globally by 2024, up from $38 billion in 2017, according to Zion Market Research. And as sales grow, tastes also appear to be shifting.\\r\\n\\r\\nSales figures published by retail technology firm, Edited, suggest that bralettes and sports bras are increasingly preferred to cleavage-enhancing push-up bras. Victoria\\'s Secret may still lead the pack with a reported 24% market share in the US, but it recently announced plans to shutter more than 50 stores following slow holiday season sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrands like ThirdLove are catering to an increasingly diverse customer base. Credit: Courtesy Third Love\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closures come amid growing competition from newer brands, many of which are catering to broader tastes. Customers are embracing lingerie that encompasses alternative forms of sex appeal, and increasingly buying from brands that prioritize body positivity, comfort and proper fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSizing up\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent labels, like US startup ThirdLove, have filled a gap in the market by serving women who struggle to find bras in the right size. When Heidi Zak co-founded the brand in 2011, she simply wanted to provide bras that fit better than those at her previous go-to store, Victoria\\'s Secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing 600 million data points across metrics including breast shape and cup fit, ThirdLove promotes half-cup sizes. Today, the online-only brand offers 78 different sizes -- and is worth an estimated $750 million, according to Forbes\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unseen history of underwear\\r\\n\\r\\nBut offering more sizes can be an expensive endeavor. The inflexibility of factory production makes it difficult to cater to everyone, according to Cora Harrington, author of the book \"In Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear, and Love Lingerie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are so many parts to a bra, sizes and variations to breasts, that it\\'s impossible for any one brand to service every single bra-wearing customer adequately,\" she said in a phone interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Harrington, who also founded the Lingerie Addict blog, a single bra can contain at least 20 individual components, including lace, closures and straps. For a luxury garment, this number can swell to 40 or 50, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd the precision sewing and pattern-making required to adjust for different sizes, then piece everything together, and it can create a product that costs more than \"what people feel is appropriate to pay for a bra.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(To) serve an adequate range of people,\" Harrington added, \"you\\'re looking at 50 to 60 sizes to start, which is far beyond what most indie designers or new brands are able to afford.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Consumer expectations are a little bit misaligned with product design and development ... people are used to fast-fashion cycles (and seeing) something on a runway, then seeing a knock-off two weeks later.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRihanna\\'s Savage X Fenty label has been celebrated for its wide range of sizes and \"nude\" tones, as well as its use of diverse runway models. Credit: Brian Ach/Getty Images North America/Getty Images for Savage X Fenty\\r\\n\\r\\nSome lingerie makers have nonetheless found ways to profitably expand their size ranges, contributing to what Harrington calls a \"bra size war.\" Rihanna\\'s Savage X Fenty, for instance, produces lingerie for plus-size body types (up to 3X and 44DDD) in addition to straight sizes, with other labels going up to 46H or higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiverse customers\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growing lingerie market is providing greater choice to another group of customers it has traditionally underserved: transgender shoppers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontreal-based Origami Customs offers gender-affirming lingerie to transgender customers, among others. With trans visibility at an all-time high, the brand has doubled sales over the last four years, according to founder Rae Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe label has recently expanded its line of binders, an undergarment used to flatten the chest, that it models on transmasculine customers. Gaffs, a type of underwear used for tucking, make up nearly half of the products that Origami Customs sells.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve felt an outpouring of gratitude from my customers (especially trans women) about the affirming process of working with me,\" Hill said in an email interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontreal-based Origami Customs offers gender-affirming lingerie to transgender customers, among others. Credit: Courtesy of Origami Customs and Rae Hill\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I take the time to work with each customer one-on-one, and I do feel that this creates a level of safety and intimacy that isn\\'t available in the mainstream market.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Being sexy is as different as each one of us,\" Hill added.\\r\\n\\r\\nRacial diversity is also a growing force in the lingerie market. Take Rihanna\\'s aforementioned label, which has been praised for producing a variety of \"nude\" tones for different skin colors. Similarly, ThirdLove\\'s recent line of T-shirt bras offers nine shades of \"naked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore either of them, London-based disruptor Nubian Skin became one of the first brands to offer nude tones for women of color when it launched in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We saw a lot of brands debut their own nude tones in the years immediately after the launch of Nubian Skin,\" Harrington said. \"Some of those brands have since rolled back (their selection) because they didn\\'t market them very well -- if you\\'re going to sell nude tone bras in deeper skin tones, it would help to use models of color.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope that, for these companies (new brands like ThirdLove and Savage X) it\\'s not a trend (but) something they plan to stick with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA matter of representation\\r\\n\\r\\nInclusivity isn\\'t just about selling lingerie to diverse customers -- it\\'s about doing so visibly. This means using models of all shapes, sizes and colors in fashion shows and campaigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake Lonely Lingerie, for instance, which claims to portray women in a realistic way by refusing to use Photoshop -- or even hair and makeup stylists -- in its campaigns. The brand\\'s models include women with 35 different bra sizes and from a variety of backgrounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand-based Lonely Lingerie says it doesn\\'t use Photoshop or hair and makeup stylists. Credit: Courtesy Lonely Lingerie\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Helene Morris said that, when she started the label in 2009, \"there was no one in the lingerie world who was speaking in a way we related to at all.\" Her brand\\'s \"Lonely Girls\" project featured senior models, breastfeeding mothers, pregnant women and disabled women, all photographed in natural light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We really wanted to give the power ... to the person being shot -- how they want to be shot, how are they most comfortable and involving the woman in that process,\" Morris said in a phone interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlus-size label Curvy Couture also sees the use of diverse models as an important step towards inclusivity, according to social media marketing manager, Summer Rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurvy Couture is \"designed, owned and operated by curvy women, for curvy women,\" said the company\\'s social media marketing manager. Credit: Courtesy Curvy Couture\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have a ton of fit models that come in -- different sizes, different ages, moms who are post-breastfeeding -- just so we can really make sure that the fit is supportive,\" she said in a phone interview. \"No matter what stage in life she is in, we want to make sure she feels her best.\"',\n",

       " 'Written by Rhonda Garelick, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article was originally published in August 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, fashion\\'s greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nGinsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those \"disappeared\" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.\\r\\n\\r\\nUS Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Credit: Tim Sloan/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond a feminizing touch\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven her historic position and stature -- she\\'s the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssociate Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\\'Connor. Credit: Paul J. Richards/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIn adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O\\'Connor, the court\\'s first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is her favorite \"majority\" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her \"dissenting\" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg\\'s opinions (to those court observers fluent in \"Ruth\") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar a day after President Donald Trump\\'s election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).\\r\\n\\r\\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\'s \"majority\" collar. Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg\\'s collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been \\'disappeared\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not \"wear\" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least\"straight, white, male physicality) as we do women\\'s. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as \"mind\" or \"spirit,\" while women represent the baser realms of \"body\" and \"flesh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRe-injecting the \\'body\\' into judicial robes\\r\\n\\r\\nTo clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices\\' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nGinsburg\\'s collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of \"body\" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy , Justice John Paul Stevens, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia , Justice David H. Souter, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Samuel Alito. Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nTo re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most \"noticeable\" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).\\r\\n\\r\\nGinsburg\\'s collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUS President Barack Obama is greeted by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as Obama arrives to deliver his State of the Union address on January 12, 2016. Credit: Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary \"RBG\" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg\\'s judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in \"RBG drag,\" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: \"Imagine yourself here! This could be you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg\\'s ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg\\'s frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct when Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar.',\n",
       " 'Written by Aric Chen\\r\\n\\r\\nAric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun\\'s Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery\\'s hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London\\'s Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early rendering of the Serpentine Pavilion Beijing, designed by Jiakun Architects. The pavilion is a stone\\'s throw from the Forbidden City. Credit: Jiakun Architects\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he\\'s based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum\\r\\n\\r\\nBut mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as \"low-tech,\" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. The temporary pavilion will be open to the public from May 30 to October 31, 2018. Credit: WF Central\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,\" said the Serpentine\\'s artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiu\\'s buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural \"realism.\" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China\\'s return as a global power.\\r\\n\\r\\nCentered on the Bird\\'s Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture\\'s power to represent and even shape a new epoch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them \" Rebirth Bricks \") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShifting attitudes\\r\\n\\r\\nA stone\\'s throw from the Forbidden City, Liu\\'s Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird\\'s Nest along the capital\\'s historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the most perfunctory glance at China\\'s ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. The pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of \"junzi,\" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer\\'s bow. Credit: Jiakun Architects\\r\\n\\r\\nOften small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s the right architect at the right time,\" the Serpentine Gallery\\'s CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of \"junzi,\" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer\\'s bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,\" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. \"It\\'s like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It\\'s pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPut another way, Liu\\'s pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it\\'s difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party\\'s headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).\\r\\n\\r\\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. Liu Jiakun\\'s style is often described as a form of architectural \"realism.\" Credit: WF Central\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing\\'s inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country\\'s architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come.',\n",
       " 'Written by Hannah Ritchie, CNN Pontassieve, Italy Contributors Muhammad Darwish\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West\\'s largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone\\'s throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.\\r\\n\\r\\nMansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once I was there, I said, \\'I\\'m actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?\\'\" Cecioni said in his studio. \"They brought me to Mansudae\\'s studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said \\'sure.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. \"Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,\" he said. \"They\\'re very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: \"There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanctions taking effect\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un\\'s regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This money is highly significant,\" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. \"We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae\\'s statue business is separate from the studio\\'s main operation -- despite being run under the same name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s like a big art company, there are many branches,\" he said. \"The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that\\'s Mansudae, but it\\'s so different from the other things they do. It\\'s definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I\\'m sure there is some direction from the (state).\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecioni said last year\\'s UN sanctions has affected his business, as he\\'s no longer able to import North Korean art.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Cecioni\\'s convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year\\'s UN sanctions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecioni\\'s ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. \"The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn\\'t slowed, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not really trying to sell anymore,\" he said, \"because we cannot replenish our inventory.\"',\n",
       " 'David Hockney\\'s home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"English Angelino,\" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it\\'s quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world\\'s most recognizable and popular artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney\\'s studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney\\'s famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist\\r\\n\\r\\nThe studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker\\'s cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He\\'s wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m little nervous at the beginning and don\\'t want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We\\'ve arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney\\'s every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c I think I\\'ve not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I\\'ve done what I want to do. â\\x80\\x9d David Hockney\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I\\'m staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn\\'t heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn\\'t find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney quickly interjects: \"Yes, they are just big voids,\" he says, referring to the TV screens. \"I don\\'t like voids.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPainting the pool\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney says that his swimming pool was also looking \"a bit like a void,\" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,\" he says. The job took him two and half hours, \"and that\\'s how long it took me 20 years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney\\'s ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. \"Of course, I thought I could do it,\" he says a little defiantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it\\'s \"a bit too pale\" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- \"Gregory wouldn\\'t like it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" (1972) by David Hockney Credit: Art Gallery of New South Wales/Jenni Carter\\r\\n\\r\\nA bigger retrospective\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pretext for our visit is Hockney\\'s 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London\\'s Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,\" says Hockney. And that\\'s the truth of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). \"Well,\" comes the blunt reply, \"it\\'s 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It\\'s arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Clark and Percy\" (1970-1971) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c I think in painting you can do things you can\\'t do in photography. Edvard Munch said photography can\\'t compete with painting because it can\\'t deal with heaven or hell. â\\x80\\x9d David Hockney\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy\" (1968) by David Hockney Credit: Tate, David Lambert and Rod Tidnam\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- \"Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called \\'coffin nails\\' then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis father had been \"a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I\\'m five years older than him now,\" he says with a certain relish.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish and chips\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney has astonishing recall. There were only \"about five copies,\" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop\\'s owners recently sold at auction for just under Â£19,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he\\'s not remotely bothered. He\\'s well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My Parents\" (1977) by David Hockney Credit: Met\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first people to acquire Hockney\\'s art was his friend and fellow student at London\\'s Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid Â£5 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. \"That was quite a lot of money then,\" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gay pioneer\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, \"Adhesiveness,\" for less than $60.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember delivering it to his house,\" he tells me. \"He had it for 40 years.\" The money helped pay for Hockney\\'s first visit to New York in 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn\\'t legalized until 1967). Those early pictures \"look rather good and stand up,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man in Shower in Beverly Hills\" (1964) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Domestic Scene Los Angeles\" (1963) by David Hockney Credit: Private collection\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'I feel 30 in the studio\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney likes to paint in silence, \"to look, and look again.\" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn\\'t talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was \"amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney laughs but doesn\\'t elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHanging by the studio staircase is Hockney\\'s design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can\\'t film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it\\'s installed by the Abbey\\'s transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. \"I\\'m perfectly happy doing this,\" he says. \"I feel 30 when I\\'m in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArtist David Hockney in his Bayswater studio Credit: Francis Goodman/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Hockney\\'s eyes are matched for color during a sitting for his waxwork for Madame Tussaud\\'s Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nHockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know \"what to do straight away\" the next morning. Painting is Hockney\\'s be-all and end-all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker\\'s laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe doesn\\'t want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can\\'t hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Travelling, I feel 80,\" he says poignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bigger book\\r\\n\\r\\nFor almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: \"Yes, I\\'ve made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of \"A Bigger Book,\" a 77-pound \"sumo\" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I realized,\" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, \"that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A Bigger Splash\" (1967) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\\r\\n\\r\\nHis own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. \"I keep looking through it,\\' he admits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I\\'ve not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,\" he muses. \"Every day I\\'ve done what I want to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a privilege\\', I say. \"I know I\\'m privileged,\" comes the reply, \"I\\'ve always known that I was privileged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney\\'s hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: \"Thank you for brightening our world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was OK, wasn\\'t it?\" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. \"Yes,\" I exclaim, \"more than OK. Thank you!\" And it\\'s true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- \"with love, David and a kiss\" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN\\'s Francesca Church, Oliver Dann, Ana Rosado, Emir Eralp, Aaron Darveniza and Fiona Sinclair Scott contributed to this story.',\n",
       " 'Written by Jonathan Chatwin, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nJonathan Chatwin is a writer, journalist and author of books including \" Long Peace Street: A Walk in Modern China .\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2035, China\\'s government expects over 70% of the country\\'s population -- around a billion people -- to be living in cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Shanghai and Beijing have announced population limits and are implementing policies to reduce the number of new arrivals. These restrictions look likely to be replicated in many of China\\'s more populous cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the rate of urbanization shows no sign of slowing. So, while existing smaller cities can absorb some of the millions who relocate, China is, with increasing haste, looking to develop entirely new urban areas in order to provide homes, jobs and infrastructure -- all while driving economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most high-profile of these is Xiongan, a new city being built across three counties in Hebei province, 100 kilometers to Beijing\\'s south west. Announced to great fanfare in April 2017, it\\'s expected to house up to 2.5 million people . Large-scale construction began in 2019 and, over the next decade, an ambitious government plan will see many of Beijing\\'s businesses, universities and hospitals relocated to this new city, alleviating pressure on the capital and encouraging hi-tech economic development in a traditionally industrial area.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesigned by Zaha Hadid Architects, the technology hub Unicorn Island outside Chengdu is one of numerous new urban areas being constructed in China. Credit: Zaha Hadid Architects/Negativ.com\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the country, China\\'s government is investing trillions of yuan to establish new areas and development zones, many of which act as satellites to existing cities. To the south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Tianfu New Area has been developed over the last decade and is soon set to open Unicorn Island , a 166-acre technology hub designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. In Changsha, capital of Hunan province, the vast and similarly ambitious Xiangjiang New Area is intended to attract hi-tech industry and is home to the country\\'s first test zone for autonomous public transport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese projects all look back to one city for inspiration: the godfather of urban transformation and the country\\'s \"model\" city, Shenzhen. Now home to over 13 million people, the southern metropolis is the Chinese government\\'s proudest symbol of the last 40 years of economic reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding on Shenzhen\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 4, 1984, the sound of firecrackers echoed through the streets of Shenzhen as the city celebrated the completion of the International Trade Center, its -- and, at the time, China\\'s -- tallest building.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeng Xiaoping, the country\\'s then paramount leader, had visited the site earlier that year and had given the project his seal of approval. He was particularly impressed by the speed of construction, which -- though it began slowly, partly due to a lack of proper equipment -- eventually reached a rate of one new floor every three days. The pace with which the upper floors of the tower were built became known as \"Shenzhen speed,\" part of the pervasive mythology that clouds the origins of this so-called \"Instant City.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShenzhen\\'s International Trade Center was once China\\'s tallest building. Credit: Imaginechina Limited/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nFor visitors to Shenzhen in the 1980s, the 50-story skyscraper dominated the city\\'s skyline. Over time, however, neighboring buildings would reach, and then exceed, the International Trade Center. As Juan Du, an architect and author of new book \"The Shenzhen Experiment\" observed in an email interview: \"This cluster of tall buildings became the image of China\\'s post-reform modernization and urbanization.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial Economic Zones\\r\\n\\r\\nAs China began reforming its economic system and opening up to the world, a process initiated by Deng in the late 1970s, Shenzhen was established as one of China\\'s first four \"Special Economic Zones,\" or SEZs. All four were chosen for their favorable geographical position and access to global markets, with Shenzhen located just across the river from the international hub of Hong Kong.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn oft-repeated myth is that Shenzhen grew from a fishing village. But in 1980 it was already a bustling market town. The surrounding areas that would become the SEZ covered almost 330 square kilometers and included a number of other pre-existing villages and towns. The official population of the SEZ at the time was 94,100, according to Du\\'s research.\\r\\n\\r\\nShenzhen has undergone a rapid transformation since the 1980s. Credit: Xinhua/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Shenzhen is now considered a success story, its establishment and early development was not without controversy. The city was, as Deng acknowledged, an experiment, and thus diverged from rules that applied to the rest of China. Shenzhen was allowed to try out comparatively radical ideas, like loosening price controls on goods and inviting foreign direct investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nShenzhen was such an exception that, for much of its existence, it was physically separated from the rest of the country by a barbed wire fence. This fortified perimeter was interspersed with seven manned checkpoints and was known as the \"Second Line\" (the first being the border with the semi-autonomous Hong Kong to the south).\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2006, visitors from other parts of China needed their passports and a special permit to enter the SEZ.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Deng visited in 1984, he asserted that SEZs were \"windows of technology, management, knowledge and foreign policy,\" designed to showcase China\\'s potential to the rest of the world -- and the rest of the country. The city was intended to become a \"national model for China\\'s modernization and urbanization,\" Du said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new Shenzhen McDonald\\'s under construction in 1990.

The country\\'s urban spaces have long emphasized the importance of symmetry, with streets traditionally laid out in straight lines running east to west and north to south. Following these principles, Shenzhen initially spread out along its first east-west avenue, whilst the city\\'s main Central Business District was laid out along a prominent north to south axis, flanked by skyscrapers and landmark architectural projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nShenzhen was not, however, a blank slate onto which a symmetrically ordered city could be drawn. Existing villages within the boundaries of the Special Economic Zone grew exponentially, as they were often the first destinations for the thousands of newcomers looking for an affordable place to live.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who owned village properties would quickly extend their houses upwards and outwards to offer low-rent accommodation for new arrivals. \"Without the villages, the city would never have grown with the famous \\'Shenzhen speed,\\'\" Jonathan Bach wrote in \"Learning from Shenzhen,\" a collection of essays on the city. \"The city could never have sustained the cost of housing and supporting so much labor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShenzhen\\'s skyline pictured at twilight. Credit: Sean Pavone/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, over time, the villages have been surrounded and overshadowed by new, more lucrative developments -- or razed by developers seeking new opportunities for growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Du observed in \"The Shenzhen Experiment,\" many people in China share a stereotyped view of the surviving villages as being \"dirty, disorderly and inferior,\" though they have been integral in driving Shenzhen\\'s success, and their vibrancy and dynamism are a key aspect of the city\\'s culture. There are still hundreds of these \"urban villages,\" and one of the unresolved challenges in Shenzhen\\'s development is how to sensitively manage and integrate them -- and the millions of people who live in them -- into an ever-growing metropolis that leaders like to promote as an orderly, model city.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new city center\\r\\n\\r\\nShenzhen has proven such a success that it\\'s now faced with a problem unimaginable to its original planners: A lack of space.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne source of new land has been found by building onto what was once the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough extensive land reclamation, the waterfront at the city\\'s southern edge was extended into the bay almost 20 years ago. A new city center business district, dubbed Shenzhen Bay Headquarters City, is now being built on that land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We intend to make Shenzhen Bay a complementary city center to the string of existing central business districts of Shenzhen,\" said Claude Godefroy of Henning Larsen Architects, one of three firms to win a competition to design the new district, in an email interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nShenzhen Bay Headquarters City is a new 2-square-mile business district. Credit: Henning Larsen Architects\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the first phase of building expected to be completed by 2022, the project features a north-south axis and showpiece skyscraper (the project\\'s main tower will reach a height of over 1,640 feet, the architects said, placing it firmly in the world\\'s 20 tallest buildings).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut beyond the superlatives, its design aims to correct the mistakes of the past. Although Shenzhen has been treated as a model city, the power of hindsight has exposed some of the original plan\\'s shortcomings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a city where \"oversize impassable highways crisscross the city and isolate neighborhoods from each other,\" as Godefroy put it, Shenzhen Bay will be pedestrian friendly. A waterfront promenade will be lined with bars and restaurants, correcting \"an historic failure in Shenzhen\\'s urban planning: its disconnection with the sea,\" he added. \"Citizens complain that they sometimes forget they are living in a coastal city.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the project\\'s goals is to attract skilled Chinese and international workers to the city. \"All megacities compete to attract the talents of tomorrow,\" Godefroy said, \"and Shenzhen lags behind in livability compared to Hong Kong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Shenzhen competing with neighboring Hong Kong, long a prosperous global trading hub, is hardly new. But a government plan published over the summer of 2019 directly declared its ambition for Shenzhen to itself become \"a capital of innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity with international influence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA worker braves the heat to weld parts on the top of Shenzhen\\'s Ping An Finance Center in 2015. Credit: Mao Siqian/Xinhua/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan emphasizes making the city more internationally open, developing its reputation as a technology hub -- it is already home to Chinese tech giants Huawei, Tencent and ZTE, among others -- and improving its environmental credentials. It is to become a \"pioneering demonstration zone of socialism with Chinese characteristics\" according to the State Council , China\\'s cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The State Council document was not part of the brief for Shenzhen Bay, but every architect involved with Shenzhen knows that is the agenda,\" said Godefroy. Although he doesn\\'t believe Shenzhen can become a true competitor to Hong Kong, as \"their economies have such a different focus,\" he said that the government\\'s ambition for the new development was very clear -- it wants to \"make this district the spearhead of a plan to position Shenzhen a model city for China and the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA model for China\\r\\n\\r\\nChina\\'s politicians have persistently tried to replicate the \"Shenzhen effect\" as they develop other urban areas around the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese new areas often feature architectural motifs reminiscent of Shenzhen, sprawling along broad, perpendicular avenues flanked by convention centers, malls and flagship skyscrapers. And, like Shenzhen, they are generally built with economic revitalization in mind, with local governments often offering favorable terms to developers and companies relocating there.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake Shanghai\\'s Pudong district, across the river from the city\\'s famous Bund, which drew inspiration from Shenzhen. In early 1990, Deng, who often wintered in Shanghai, began to encourage China\\'s next generation of leaders to allow Pudong -- relatively rural in comparison to the city it faced across the water -- to redevelop, saying that he had made a mistake by not including Shanghai in the original group of Special Economic Zones in 1979. According to Ezra Vogel\\'s 2011 biography of Deng, the paramount leader argued the city could, at least, benefit from developing later than Shenzhen by learning the lessons of its predecessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping in Shenzhen\\'s Lianhuashan Park. Credit: Eric0911/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nPudong has since become home to a famed skyline punctuated by some of China\\'s tallest buildings, and the center of the country\\'s financial sector. The district\\'s planning and development was certainly more centralized and coordinated than that of Shenzhen, but despite innovative plans proposed by international architecture firms, Pudong ended up re-articulating the same ideas of urban development: build quickly and ambitiously, maximize land value and prioritize the commercial over the human.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond Pudong, China has struggled to successfully export Shenzhen\\'s remarkable example. Even the other three SEZs established at the same time as Shenzhen -- Shantou, Xiamen and Zhuhai -- failed to develop in anything like the same explosive manner. A myriad of different factors has influenced this -- geography, size and scale, specific local policies and the nature of the cities\\' populations. As Du noted in her book, \"Shenzhen ... is not a singular transferable model but a plurality, informed by local conditions and local communities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nXiongan, Xi\\'s model city\\r\\n\\r\\nBeijing\\'s new satellite city, Xiongan, is China\\'s latest attempt to replicate the success of Shenzhen. President Xi Jinping has appointed Shenzhen\\'s former mayor and party chief, Xu Qin, as governor of Hebei province, where the city is being built. State media has referred to Xiongan as the \" Shenzhen of the North \" while, according to its master plan, the project is intended to become \"a model city in the history of human development.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are differences between Xiongan\\'s development and that of Shenzhen, however. Most obviously, whereas all of the original Special Economic Zones were coastal areas designed to attract foreign capital, Xiongan is 150 kilometers from the nearest coastline.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will mainly serve a center for domestic, rather than international, industries -- in particular, many of the country\\'s massive state-owned enterprises currently based in Beijing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree counties, 100 kilometers to Beijing\\'s south west in Hebei province, are set to be transformed into a brand new city. Credit: Costfoto/Barcroft Media/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government also emphasizes that Xiongan will be a green \"smart city,\" built on a more human scale and with lower population density than China\\'s sprawling megacities. The city will be comparatively low-rise, and free from the ever-taller skyscrapers that define most new urban developments. Early work has focused on improving environmental conditions in what is one of the most polluted areas of China, with the sizeable Baiyangdian Lake -- around which the city will be oriented -- subject to an intensive clean-up operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with Shenzhen, Xiongan must also navigate the complexities of managing the area\\'s existing population. When Xiongan was first announced, a rush of real estate trading led the government to freeze property sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government has subsequently restricted speculation further by announcing that housing in Xiongan will be subject to strict state controls -- a substantial change to the policy of Shenzhen, where property development was a key driver of economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the existing residents have already been relocated and compensated. But with a population of around 1 million people in the area -- and over 500 villages to be redeveloped -- enabling satisfactory outcomes for low-income and often older rural residents remains problematic.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne key similarity between the two cities, however, is in the way Xiongan will be integrated into a greater conglomeration of urban centers. Just as Shenzhen now blends almost imperceptibly into the Pearl River Delta\\'s other cities, such as Guangzhou and Dongguan, so Xiongan will be connected via high-speed rail with Beijing and Tianjin, to its east, to form a 130-million-person megalopolis nicknamed \\'Jing-Jin-Ji\\' (a portmanteau of the names of Beijing, Tianjin and \"Ji,\" an ancient name for Hebei province).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aerial shot of the Xiongan New Area, which is expected to one day house up to 2.5 million people. Credit: Costfoto/Barcroft Media/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is clearly no lack of ambition for Xiongan. It is a project that reflects the ambitions and concerns of China\\'s current leadership, with Xi seemingly hoping to emulate Deng\\'s legacy in Shenzhen by very publicly attaching his name to the project. \"General Secretary Xi Jinping has planned for, made decisions on and promoted (Xiongan) in person, devoting painstaking efforts,\" read a 2018 planning document.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extent to which Xiongan will copy -- or diverge from -- the template established by the model city of Shenzhen remains to be seen. But what is indisputable is that Shenzhen\\'s example, both positive and negative, remains hugely influential in China\\'s urban planning, even four decades after the city was established.',\n",

Nini and Treadwell may not know the circumstances in which the pictures were taken, but they believe the subjects\\' body language and mutual gazes are, unmistakably, those of romantic lovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, they have published more than 300 of the pictures in the book \"Loving: A Photographic History of Men in Love, 1850s-1950s.\" Together, they offer intimate glimpses into romantic lives that would likely have remained hidden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This book means, for the first time, that these people, these couples, get to speak for themselves,\" Nini said. \"They couldn\\'t do it when they were alive, but they can do it now, and I think that\\'s really powerful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn image believed to be from the turn of the 20th century.

They memorialized their feelings with these photographs, and then had to hide them forever,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nForbidden love\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photos show young couples that could have only dreamed of the freedoms afforded to Nini and Treadwell, who wed unofficially in 1992 (and then legally 14 years later, after Massachusetts became the first US state to permit same-sex marriage).\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, their collection shows historical examples of men exchanging rings and partaking in informal wedding ceremonies. In one image, believed to be from the turn of the 20th century, a young pair are seen holding a sign reading, \"Not married but willing to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as showing the evolution of attitudes, hairstyles and fashion through the decades, the images also chart the development of photography as a medium. The collection\\'s oldest pictures were made using early forms of camera, and include ambrotypes, which were produced on glass, and daguerreotypes, which appeared on metal plates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as posed portraits, the collection contains pictures of couples lying in bed and having picnics. Credit: Courtesy Nini-Treadwell Collection/5 Continents Editions\\r\\n\\r\\nThe archive travels through to the emergence of paper photography and then photo booths, which, like the various shots taken in the reflections of mirrors, eliminated the need to confide in a photographer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while Nini and Treadwell know next to nothing about their subjects, they know even less about where the physical photos have been in the decades since.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of the pictures have creases in them, so perhaps they were folded and put in a wallet, while some are pristine, where they had been tucked in a book or hidden away in a drawer,\" Treadwell said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s astonishing to us to wonder what that journey was -- not only for the couple but for the photograph being passed along.

       " 'James Griffiths , CNN Hong Kong Written by\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a young man in Beijing in the 1980s, Lun Zhang felt like he was taking part in a new Chinese enlightenment.\\r\\n\\r\\nbecoming newly available. The country was undergoing paramount leader Deng Xiaoping\\'s \" Reform and Opening Up ,\" and previously sealed-off areas of knowledge, arts, and culture werebecoming newly available.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who had only years before been living in the stifling, hyper-Maoist orthodoxy of the Cultural Revolution, in which anything foreign or historical was deemed counter-revolutionary, could now listen to Wham!, hold intellectual salons in which people read Jean-Paul Sartre or Sigmund Freud, or even publish their own works, taking aim at previously sacred political targets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In those days, our thirst to read, learn and explore the outside world was insatiable,\" Zhang writes in his new graphic novel, \"Tiananmen 1989: Our Shattered Hopes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with this intellectual awakening came a growing frustration with the pace of reform in China, particularly how economic liberalization was taking precedence over any suggestion that the Communist Party give up its tight control on the country\\'s politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn apocryphal quote attributed to Deng captured the mood at this time, that \"to get rich is glorious,\" but for many people, it was increasingly apparent that only a handful were becoming wealthy, while others were suffering due to growing corruption and the destruction of the social safety net.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall demonstrations against graft and for greater political reform ballooned into what would become the 1989 Tiananmen movement , in which hundreds of thousands of people protested across the country, with the largest demonstration in Beijing led by workers and student groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square for months, even holding meetings with top officials. At the time, many felt hopeful that these actions would bring about wider societal change in the one-party state.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrackdown\\r\\n\\r\\nZhang was on the square that spring, when the protesters put forward seven demands, including for democratic elections and an end to state censorship. He was there as the crowds paid tribute to the late reformist leader Hu Yaobang, and he was there as the occupiers sang and danced on what had become the people\\'s square.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not there when soldiers opened fire on protesters and fought with them in the streets of the Chinese capital. He was not there when the tanks rolled in. Zhang was in the suburbs of the city with another activist, recuperating in preparation for what some thought would be a last push before the government gave into the protesters\\' demands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When we heard the army had entered Beijing, we tried to reach the square, but our efforts were in vain,\" Zhang writes of when they learned of the bloodshed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from reaching the center of the city, Zhang\\'s attention turned to escape: the authorities were rounding up prominent protesters and leaders, and he was worried about arrest. He fled first to rural China, eventually becoming one of dozens of Tiananmen protesters smuggled into Hong Kong by activists in the then British colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn excerpt from \"Tiananmen 1989: Our Shattered Hopes.\" Zhang (pictured wearing a sash on the bottom left) was a young sociology teacher in the late 1980s. During protests, he was in charge of management and safety. Credit: IDW Publishing\\r\\n\\r\\nGraphic novel\\r\\n\\r\\nZhang eventually moved to France, where he has lived ever since, and is teaching at the Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris. While he writes about the Chinese economy and geopolitics, he has largely left out his own personal history prior to this month\\'s publication of his graphic novel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I worked with (French journalist) Adrien Gombeaud, who wrote the script for the format,\" Zhang told CNN. \"We read some graphic novels about historical events, and together came up with the plan, for example, to imagine a theater scene to link all the parts of the story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Tiananmen Square Massacre has been widely covered in the media and in documentaries, with many focusing on the iconic image of the Tank Man or utilizing archive footage from the square itself, much of the events leading up to the infamous night have been lost to history, available only through witnesses\\' accounts. Zhang said that the comics format provided a key means of capturing the emotion of the demonstrations, in a way that does not necessarily come across in text.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult to find a satisfactory way in which this kind of big event is reported, in my opinion,\" he said. \"In some reporting on Tiananmen, the authors didn\\'t reflect enough on the will of students to cooperate with the authorities in peacefully reforming China.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you take into account the emotion involved, we can understand why the peaceful way of demonstration was chosen, why there was the huge hunger strike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the initial script was written, the authors worked with French artist Ameziane to develop the comic\\'s visuals, by sourcing images of the various characters, and referencing archival photos of era-appropriate objects, such as clothes, cars and teacups from 1980s China. \"We spent a lot of time in discussions on how to arrange the scenes, how to convey the essential message, what limits we might have on a given page. It played to the style and skill of our painter,\" Zhang said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shift in artistic style is most notable in the scenes depicting the massacre itself. Prior pages feature white backgrounds and muted colors, but as the crackdown begins, the pages turn to black, with a heavy use of oranges and reds. Ameziane\\'s illustrations become looser and full of movement, emphasizing the chaos and panic experienced by the characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book is structured in several acts, with Zhang as its narrator. He said the play format was an obvious storytelling device, given \"the protest movement itself felt like a drama, with its different phases akin to great acts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nComics journalism\\r\\n\\r\\nZhang, Gombeaud and Ameziane\\'s book joins what has quietly become a major strand of modern comics: graphic journalism or historical comics dealing with topics that were once considered out of the art form\\'s remit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican cartoonist Art Spiegelman\\'s \"Maus,\" a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of his parents\\' experiences as Holocaust survivors -- with the Jews depicted as mice and the Nazis as cats -- has long been considered a masterwork in the graphic novel genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile adult themes and history were features in comics long before \"Maus\" debuted in 1980, including in Spiegelman\\'s own work, its use of accessible, black and white art combined with a sweeping historical narrative broke into the mainstream, and set a new standard for \"grown up\" comics with political subject matter and potentially upsetting content.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks like Maltese-American Joe Sacco\\'s ground-breaking comics journalism in \"Palestine\" or \"Safe Area Gorazde,\" and French-Iranian Marjane Satrapi\\'s \"Persepolis\" have further driven this trend, with the latter turned into an Oscar-nominated movie in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popularity of comics and graphic novels has only grown in recent years -- with the help of blockbuster film adaptations. This has happened in conjunction with the rise of comics journalism, in everything from newspapers to dedicated publications such as The Nib , which has long recognized the medium\\'s ability to tackle serious issues, interweaving reporting with satirical cartoons.\\r\\n\\r\\nSacco has talked about how the use of comics, the presentation of the artist and writer as a figure in the story, helps remove \"the illusion that a journalist is a fly on the wall, all seeing and all knowing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nin a \"To me, drawing myself signals to the reader that I\\'m a filter between the information, the people and them. They know that I\\'m a presence, and that they\\'re seeing things through my eyes,\" he saidin a recent interview\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is very much apparent in Zhang\\'s book, as he uses his role as narrator to critique both the protest movement and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tiananmen 1989: Our Shattered Hopes\" cover. Credit: IDW Publishing\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked once about whether drawing helped him deal with being the child of Holocaust survivors, Spiegelman answered : \"I\\'ve had therapy, and I\\'ve made comics. The comics are cheaper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of \"Maus\" deals with Spiegelman\\'s guilt over his difficult relationship with his father and in comparing his problems with depression and work to the experiences of his parents. Zhang too writes in \"Tiananmen\" of his own survivor\\'s guilt and of questioning his decisions made as a younger man in the midst of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview, Zhang said he did not write about Tiananmen for so long, because his role, his involvement, seemed inconsequential compared to what some went through.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The way I saw it, there were many people dead or wounded in the aftermath, and many people lost their jobs; their families were never the same after,\" he said. \"The real heroes were the ordinary students and people in (Beijing) and other cities. By comparison, what I did personally didn\\'t seem worth telling. The most important thing I could do was live my life in a way that wouldn\\'t dishonor the dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was eventually convinced by an editor to write the book last year, around the 30th anniversary of the massacre. \"She convinced me that I had a duty to the memory of that time,\" Zhang said. \"I accepted it. \\'No justice, no peace,\\' but I think also, \\'No memory, no justice.\\'\"',\n",

       " 'Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more unknown and curious design origin stories here\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many of history\\'s greatest ideas, Tetris came about quite unintentionally.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexey Pajitnov was a software engineer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, tasked with testing a new type of computer, the Electronika 60. To do so, he wrote a simple game based on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help assess how powerful the computer was -- and provide a bit of fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle did he know that the resulting game would go on to become one of the greatest, most addictive and most successful of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was June 6, 1984, and Tetris had just started its journey from behind the Iron Curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original version of Tetris.\\r\\n\\r\\nTetris is a puzzle game in which geometric shapes called \"tetrominoes\" fall down onto a playing field, and the player has to arrange them to form gapless lines. Pajitnov took inspiration from pentomino, a classic puzzle game consisting of all the different shapes that can be made by combining five squares -- 12 in total -- with the goal of arranging them in a wooden box like a jigsaw puzzle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo simplify things, he knocked that down to four squares, thus reducing the number of shapes from 12 to seven. He called the game Tetris, combining the Greek numeral \"tetra\" (meaning four) and tennis, his favorite sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nPajitnov himself was immediately hooked. \"I couldn\\'t stop myself from playing this prototype version, because it was very addictive to put the shapes together,\" he said on the phone from Seattle, where he now lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nTetris was inspired by pentomino, a classic board game.

It was only through the sheer brilliance of its design that Tetris was transformed from a quirky test program into a worldwide phenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord of mouth\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Tetris became immediately popular among programmers with access to an Electronika 60, the machine had no graphical capabilities -- and less memory than today\\'s calculators. Pressed with requests to create a version of the game for the IBM PC, a more widespread computer with better graphics, Pajitnov assigned the job to Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old student on a summer job at his office (today an engineer at Google). The game spread quickly. \"It was like a wood fire. Everyone in the Soviet Union who had a PC had Tetris on it,\" said Pajitnov.\\r\\n\\r\\nPajitnov wasn\\'t making any money off the game, nor did he intend to. Ideas were owned by the state and the very concept of selling software as a product was unfamiliar to him. People were just sharing Tetris through word of mouth and by copying it onto floppy disks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, Pajitnov heard rumors that the game might have crossed borders and was being played in other Eastern bloc countries. In 1986, he got a message via telex -- a forerunner of the fax machine -- from Robert Stein, a salesman for a Hungary-based software company called Andromeda. Stein, who had seen Tetris in Hungary, wanted to secure the rights to sell it as a computer game in the West. He offered significant money in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My English was really bad at that time, so I put together some kind of positive answer, saying we were very glad to receive the proposal and that some agreement could be made,\" said Pajitnov. He knew that doing business directly with a Western firm could have landed him in jail, even before making any money, so he started investigating how he could sell the rights to Tetris through the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nStein, however, interpreted his response as a green light and immediately started producing the game. But as he was preparing to launch, he received another telex from Elorg -- short for Electronorgtechnica, the Soviet organization that oversaw software and hardware exports. It said that the rights had not been officially granted and that his launch was illegal.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, Stein cleared the rights, and Tetris was released as a commercial PC title in the UK and the US in 1988. The game played up its Soviet origins through Kremlin-themed illustrations and Cyrillic characters. But the misunderstanding between Pajitnov and Stein showed how tricky it would be to export a video game from Soviet Russia to the West for the first time -- an issue that led to years of confusion and legal battles, and is even rumored to have landed on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\\r\\n\\r\\nPajitnov and his son with the UK and US PC versions of Tetris in 1989. Credit: Wojtek Laski/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Game Boy\\r\\n\\r\\nTetris was selling well on computers, but the big money in the games sector was being made elsewhere: consoles. Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game developer and businessman living in Japan, was the first to realize that Tetris was a perfect match for the Game Boy, a new handheld system released by Nintendo in Japan in early 1989. The console was about to launch in North America and Europe too, and Rogers set out to convince the company to bundle a copy of the game in the box, a common practice outside of Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,\" said Rogers in a phone interview. \"He said, \\'Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario.\\' And I said, \\'If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRogers set out to obtain the necessary permissions, and soon realized what a challenge that would be. He had already published a version of Tetris in Japan, for the popular Nintendo Famicom home system, only to discover that there were half a dozen companies all claiming to own the rights to the game. \"So I got on a plane and went to Moscow on a tourist visa to track down the source of the rights, Elorg -- and talk my way into it,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in Moscow, Rogers made little progress until he hired an interpreter, who swiftly took him to Elorg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She knew immediately where everything was, so that was fishy. They\\'re not supposed to talk to foreigners, and I wasn\\'t supposed to talk to the Russians, let alone people inside the government. So I broke all kinds of rules by being there. They interrogated me for two hours. I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut among the officials in the room was Alexey Pajitnov, who immediately took a liking to Rogers. \"Alexey was the only guy in the room who actually knew anything about games,\" Rogers recalled. \"I explained how business worked, and we became friends. A week later, I left Moscow with a signed agreement for Tetris on the Game Boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHenk Rogers and Alexey Pajitnov in Moscow\\'s Red Square.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Game Boy version of Tetris sold 35 million units and helped the console become one of the most successful of all time. It is still considered by many -- Pajitnov included -- to be the best version of Tetris, and it created an unprecedented synergy between hardware and software, epitomizing the gaming mantra \"easy to learn, hard to master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDelayed royalties\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the game\\'s success, Pajitnov was still not making any money from it. \"There was a lot of legal trouble, and when the question of ownership and the original source of the game came up, I decided that I wanted everything to go smoothly and I granted the rights to the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for 10 years,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legal trouble culminated in a skirmish between Nintendo and Atari over the home console rights for Tetris. A judge ruled in Nintendo\\'s favor in late 1989, dealing a lethal blow to Atari, which had already produced hundreds of thousands of now useless copies of its version of the game, under the tagline \"Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game.\" Nintendo took a different approach, opting for the slogan \"From Russia with fun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991, with the help of his friend Henk Rogers. And when his deal over the rights expired in 1995, he finally started receiving royalties for the game. \"And they\\'ve been fine so far,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPajitnov and Rogers in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company, to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. In 2005, the Tetris Company bought Elorg -- which after the fall of the Soviet Union had transformed from a state-owned company into a private one -- gaining total control of all Tetris rights worldwide. The company has even standardized and trademarked the names and colors of every Tetris piece -- officially called Tetriminos , rather than the generic tetrominoes, although they have many unofficial nicknames\\r\\n\\r\\nTetris has been the subject of several scientific studies. One found that playing the game can be effective in fighting off cravings for food and even drugs, while another noted an increase in the thickness of some parts of the brain in people who had played regularly. Playing Tetris for prolonged periods of time can lead to players dreaming to about the falling pieces or interpreting real-world objects as tetrominoes and mentally re-arranging them -- a phenomenon known as \"the Tetris Effect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, Tetris has been released on over 65 platforms, a world record , with more than half a billion downloads on mobile devices, according to the Tetris Company. Pajitnov has personally worked on over 100 variants of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest, released in early 2019 to coincide with the game\\'s 35th anniversary, is an online multiplayer version called \"Tetris 99,\" which can be played by up to 99 players simultaneously. Since 2010, an eSports tournament based on the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris has seen the world\\'s best players gather in Portland, Oregon. Some of the matches, which can surpass 30 minutes in length, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It hasn\\'t lost any of its play value and nothing has come to replace Tetris,\" said Henk Rogers, explaining the game\\'s enduring popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s like \\'Happy Birthday.\\' There have been lots of songs that come and go, but \\'Happy Birthday\\' is it still always sung in the same way. Tetris has become the \\'Happy Birthday\\' of computer games.\"',\n",
       " 'Written by Matthew Ponsford, CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember when Jackie Kennedy attended her husband\\'s presidential inauguration with a perfect egg-shaped pillbox hat perched atop her head?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s because it was meant to be unmissable.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything that happened on January 20, 1961, was stage-managed to tell America that a new age was dawning. John F. Kennedy was set to become the first US leader born in the 20th century, the first Catholic commander-in-chief and the first president whose inaugural speech was beamed across crackly television screens in color\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,\" he implored a nation in need of reassurance and leadership at the height of the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Kennedy with First Lady Jackie at his inauguration. Credit: Leonard McCombe/The LIFE Picture Collection/The LIFE Picture Collection via\\r\\n\\r\\nNot everything worked out as planned. Eight inches of snow fell on Washington overnight, winds lashed and, among all this, one accident would end up infiltrating American wardrobes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJackie\\'s orb-like hat had been made to match a coat and fawn dress already created for her by her personal courtier Oleg Cassini. But it was also designed to look different: A cloth pillbox was exactly what everyone else would not be wearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the freezing cold, many of the women sported stolid mink caps -- except Jackie, who stood out as the beacon of a new generation, characterized by clean lines and elegance. She appeared on the steps of the Capitol like \"the gorgeous petal in a dowdy bouquet of fur,\" according to Thurston Clarke, author of \"Ask Not,\" a book about the 1961 inauguration.\\r\\n\\r\\nJackie\\'s distinctive headpiece was designed by Halston (real name Roy Halston Frowick). Later known as the creator of the free-flowing, slinky fashion of the 1970s disco era, Halston was then an up-and-coming New York milliner. He apparently spent hours sandwiched between two mirrors, shaping Jackie\\'s hat into a perfect, simple dome.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept, of course, it didn\\'t end up like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeet America\\'s first superstar fashion designer\\r\\n\\r\\nThat morning, as she reached up to clasp the hat in high winds, Kennedy accidentally gave it a dimple -- a shallow indent, unnoticed but broadcast around the world. America swooned nonetheless. Kennedy\\'s deification as the ultimate first lady of fashion had begun with a misshapen hat, its influence stretching to imitators from high society to the rural Midwest. Halston later laughed that \"everybody who copied it put a dent in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackie\\'s ensemble that day -- which she completed with a sable circlet and muff -- has become one of the most celebrated of presidential inauguration looks. But there\\'s one thing we may have all been getting wrong: the color.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most Americans will remember the first lady in duck-egg blue , complementing JFK\\'s steel blue waistcoat and tie, color film footage from \"Halston,\" a CNN Films documentary about the legendary designer, shows her inauguration outfit appearing pinkish. And researchers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, where the outfit is stored, told CNN that the dress and hat were basically colorless -- a neutral, fawnish beige and not even slightly blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the mistake seems to be a color photograph from Life Magazine . But the cover of the same issue featured a very different photograph: Jackie in far less vivid tones, closer to the off-white captured by the handful of other press photographers present (early color film often struggled to match real hues).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when, in 2017, Melania Trump wore a powder blue Ralph Lauren inauguration suit likened to Kennedy\\'s, was it a tribute to an outfit that never existed?\\r\\n\\r\\nwas Melania Trump paying tribute to a dress that wasn\\'t really blue? Credit: Pool/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of color, dimpled or not, the pillbox hat would become synonymous with Jackie\\'s style as first lady. She wore one the day JFK was shot, twinned with a raspberry pink suit. The blood-covered suit is locked away in the National Archives, with instructions that it should hidden from public view until at least 2103 . The pink hat hasn\\'t been seen since the fateful day she last wore it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the eulogizing of the first lady\\'s \"looks\" risks relegating her to the role of a mere mannequin, when she in fact directed much of the new administration\\'s aesthetic -- and not just when it came to fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe may have spent fewer than three years in the White House, but during that time she brought in designers, including StÃ©phane Boudin, to modernize its interior. She also worked with legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy, the man behind the Lucky Strike cigarette packet and classic Studebaker cars, to choose the enduring powder blue of the US presidential plane, Air Force One.\\r\\n\\r\\nJFK\\'s inauguration marked the beginning of a new era of media-savvy presidents -- and he had his wife to thank for much of it.',\n",
       " 'Written by Julia Wolkoff\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article was published in partnership with Artsy, the global platform for discovering and collecting art. The original article can be seen here . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mysteries of the ancient Egyptians are vast, but their beauty tricks are no secret. Makeup might seem like a modern phenomenon -- one that has grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry -- but cosmetics were equally important to daily life in the ancient world. From the earliest era of the Egyptian empire, men and women from all social classes liberally applied eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipstick and rouge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perceived seductiveness of Egyptian civilization has a lot to do with how we\\'ve glamorized its two most famous queens: Cleopatra and Nefertiti. In 1963, Elizabeth Taylor defined the chic Egyptian look when she portrayed Cleopatra in the eponymous epic. In 2017, Rihanna (herself a makeup magnate) perfected it when she paid tribute to Nefertiti on the cover of Vogue Arabia. In their homages, both beauty icons wore saturated blue eyeshadow and thick, dark eyeliner.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet ancient Egyptians didn\\'t only apply makeup to enhance their appearances -- cosmetics also had practical uses, ritual functions, or symbolic meanings. Still, they took their beauty routines seriously: The hieroglyphic term for makeup artist derives from the root \"sesh,\" which translates to write or engrave, suggesting that a lot of skill was required to apply \"kohl\" or lipstick (as anyone who has tried to emulate beauty tutorials on YouTube can attest).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most refined beauty rituals were carried out at the toilettes of wealthy Egyptian women. A typical regimen for such a woman living during the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2030-1650 B.C.) would have been indulgent, indeed. Before applying any makeup, she would first prepare her skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nA detail of a painting from the tomb of Nakht depicting three ladies at a feast. They wear perfumed cones in their hair and elaborate necklaces. Credit: Werner Forman/Universal Images Group Editorial/UIG via Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nShe might exfoliate with Dead Sea salts or luxuriate in a milk bath -- milk-and-honey face masks were popular treatments. She could apply incense pellets to her underarms as deodorant, and floral- or spice-infused oils to soften her skin. Egyptians also invented a natural method of waxing with a mixture of honey and sugar. \"Sugaring,\" as it\\'s called today, has been revived by beauty companies as a less painful alternative to hot wax.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all this, a servant would bring in the many ingredients and tools necessary to create and apply her makeup. These apparatuses, containers and applicators were themselves lavish art objects that communicated social status. Calcite jars held makeup or unguents and perfumes and containers for eye paint and oils were crafted from expensive materials like glass, gold or semi-precious stones. Siltstone palettes used to crush materials for kohl and eyeshadow were carved to resemble animals, goddesses or young women.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosmetic Spoon in the Shape of Swimming Woman Holding a Dish, ca. 1390-1352 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\r\\n\\r\\nThese symbols represented rebirth and regeneration, and the act of grinding pigments on an animal palette was thought to grant the wearer special capabilities by overcoming the creature\\'s power. (Members of the lower classes used more modest tools when applying their own makeup.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant would create eyeshadow by mixing powdered malachite with animal fat or vegetable oils. While the lady sat at her toilette, before a polished bronze \"mirror,\" the servant would use a long ivory stick -- perhaps carved with an image of the goddess Hathor -- to sweep on the rich green pigment. Just as women do today, eyeshadow would be followed with a thick line of black kohl around her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of the routine had practical purposes beyond beautifying the wearer. Kohl was used by both sexes and all social classes to protect the eyes from the intense glare of the desert sun. The Egyptian word for \"makeup palette\" derives from their word meaning \"to protect,\" a reference to its defensive abilities against the harsh sunlight or the \"evil eye.\" Additionally, the toxic, lead-based mineral that it was made from had antibacterial properties when combined with moisture from the eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombs with Carved Animals, ca. 3900-3500 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final touches to this lady\\'s makeup would, of course, be red lipstick -- a classic look even today. To make the paint, ochre was typically blended with animal fat or vegetable oil, though Cleopatra was known to crush beetles for her perfect shade of red. These highly toxic concoctions, often mixed with dyes extracted from iodine and bromine mannite, could lead to serious illness, or sometimes death -- possibly where the phrase \"kiss of death\" derives from.\\r\\n\\r\\nTweezer-Razor, ca. 1560-1479 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\r\\n\\r\\nIn death, too, personal appearance was crucial to Egyptian identity. Burial sites uncovered from the very beginning of the society\\'s history, in pre-dynastic times, show that it was common for Egyptians to include everyday items like combs, scented ointments, jewelry and cosmetics in the graves of men, women and children (many graves have been found with makeup still inside them).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe might closely associate the Egyptians with their dramatic beauty looks largely because of their prolific use on mummies and death masks. Instead of depicting their subjects\\' real features, these cartonnage masks and wooden coffins portray idealized youths with smooth skin and kohl-rimmed eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosmetic Dish in the Shape of a Trussed Duck, ca. 1353-1327 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, mummification itself followed many of the daily self-care rituals Egyptians followed while alive. Unguents for softening the skin took on religious significance when they were used to anoint the body, and even cosmetics were sometimes applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe singular Egyptian aesthetic -- from architecture to art to makeup -- has captured the modern imagination for its elegance, exoticism and style. Yet the ancient kingdom\\'s influence on our beauty ideals is more direct through its inventions, down to the eyeliner and lipstick we still love to wear.',\n",

The roommates became fast friends, exploring the city together, hanging out at Manhattan rooftop bars and teaching one another their respective languages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It turned out to be a great friendship,\" says Hidalgo, the sort where \"you kind of feel like you\\'re related to them right away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Blaya left New York, the two friends stayed in touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, he was preparing to get married and Hidalgo was delighted to be part of his celebrations, bringing along her friend Abe Wood as a plus one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Americans flew into Madrid, spending a few days sightseeing before heading down to Seville. They were excited to catch up with Blaya and his wife-to-be, MarÃ\\xada, but they weren\\'t due to see any of their mutual friends until the big day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning of the wedding, Hidalgo perfected her hair and make-up. Dressed to impress, she and Wood decided to get a cab to the church -- they figured it was the easiest option.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We didn\\'t know where we were going, and we didn\\'t want to be late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey gave the cab driver the address -- a church in Seville\\'s Triana neighborhood. When the driver pulled up outside their destination, other guests were already arriving, a riot of colorful hats, smart suits and smiles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were there early, and just by my nature, I talk to everybody,\" says Hidalgo. \"So I introduced myself to a lot of people, I took pictures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHidalgo snapped shots of bridesmaids wearing flowing red gowns, the glamorous mother-of-the-groom and the ornate interior of the church. She even asked some guests if they\\'d pose for a picture with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHidalgo is Mexican-American, and she was keen to make the most of the opportunity to speak Spanish.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe asked one fellow guest if they were there for Jose or MarÃ\\xada. The woman looked at her, blankly, and eventually replied that she was \"there for the bride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI guess she didn\\'t understand me, thought Hidalgo, and shrugged it off.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicole Hidalgo with her plus one, Abe Wood, at the wrong wedding. Courtesy Nicole Hidalgo\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the ceremony about to start, Hidalgo and Wood, her plus one, nabbed a seat near the front. The two friends posed for a selfie, and Hidalgo glanced around the congregation, looking for familiar faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time, she properly took in that she didn\\'t recognize anyone else present. She and Blaya had mutual friends, but she couldn\\'t spot any of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while Hidalgo had never met Blaya\\'s family members, she\\'d seen lots of photos. They definitely weren\\'t there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For sure they would be here now, because the wedding\\'s about to start,\" she thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nHidalgo felt a sinking feeling in her stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at Abe, who\\'d picked up on her discomfort. \"I\\'m not sure what we should do,\" she whispered. \"I have a weird feeling about this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning around in her seat to see if she recognized anyone behind her, Hidalgo squinted thorough the open church door, looking for the number on the building across the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was numbered somewhere in the 50s. That made no sense. Blaya\\'s wedding was taking place at number 79.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the wrong church.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer heart sank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re at the wrong wedding,\" she said to Wood, barely believing her own words. He looked at her in disbelief.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content I was trapped naked on a German fire escape\\r\\n\\r\\nDash to the church\\r\\n\\r\\nUnspoken between the two friends was the same thought: the ceremony was about to start. They needed to leave ASAP and hope they had time to find Blaya\\'s wedding and make it there before the ceremony began.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood up in their seats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt like we were the loud Americans. We try to get out of the church discreetly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDoing their best to ignore the heads turning in their wake, they made it outside. There, they figured out that the right church -- where Blaya\\'s wedding was beginning any minute -- must be further down the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicole Hidalgo almost attended the wrong wedding in Seville, Spain, pictured here.

Hidalgo felt her hair start to tangle and her makeup begin to run.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, they spotted another church. Outside, they recognized a couple of people smoking on the doorstep: mutual friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We saw them standing outside and just a wave of relief washed over me. I can\\'t imagine if we flew all that way and then missed the wedding,\" says Hidalgo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese wedding guests greeted the disheveled pair, who breathlessly explained what had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading inside, Hidalgo and Abe found seats just in time to see the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content He flew to Paris to surprise his girlfriend.

On a day full of memorable moments -- not all of them for the right reasons -- one of her favorite memories is the newlyweds\\' arrival at the reception: they danced together, a traditional Spanish flamenco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was just so beautiful, and that\\'s one of my favorite memories. I\\'m just so glad I got to see that,\" says Hidalgo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe couple had also installed a signpost with arrows pointing in the direction of the different locations their guests had flown in from -- from the United States and the UK, to cities across Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw New York City and, again, I was like, \\'Oh I\\'m so glad I made it,\\'\" recalls Hidalgo.\\r\\n\\r\\nHidalgo stresses that nearly missing a close friend\\'s wedding was very out of character. She\\'s a project manager who prides herself on being detailed orientated and planning ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut attending a wedding abroad, she figured just hopping in a cab was best.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Blaya, busy getting married, had no idea what had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted her to be present on one of the most important days of my life,\" he tells CNN Travel. \"To be honest, I didn\\'t know that she almost missed the best wedding of the day until after the ceremony.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he found out what happened, Blaya thought it was hilarious. It\\'s since become a running joke between the two friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, it\\'s a story Hidalgo often ends up telling.

For others, it\\'ll be ancient Rome -- the magnificent Colosseum, maybe. But for many, it\\'ll be another big, round and eminently photogenic Italian icon: a wheel of pizza.\\r\\n\\r\\nColorful, comforting and infinitely tasty, it\\'s little wonder that pizza is one of the world\\'s most beloved dishes. It\\'s a food that has transcended its Italian origins to find new takes -- from pineapple-topped pizzas to deep dish Chicago-style pies.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo wonder it has whole days devoted to it around the globe -- from January\\'s World Pizza Day to National Pizza Day, which takes place in the United States every February 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while we think of it as a 20th-century global phenomenon, pizza didn\\'t only start traveling when it crossed the Atlantic. In fact, it made its first cross-cultural journey about 2,000 years earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The term and concept is a very old one,\" says Diego Zancani, emeritus professor of medieval and modern languages at Oxford University and author of \" How We Fell in Love with Italian Food .\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Ancient Greeks had \\'pissa\\' or \\'pita\\', and a recent study connected the term \\'pizza\\' with the various \\'pita\\' that exist all over the Mediterranean. So the concept is very old -- but [ancient pissa] was bread, sometimes fried and sometimes baked, possibly with condiments on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food popped up again -- this time as \"pizza\" -- in 997 CE. A rental document for a house in Gaeta, north of Naples, promised to pay the owner pork meat and pizza -- but even then, Zancani says, the mysterious \"pizza\" would have been pieces of bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast forward to 1570, and the Pope\\'s head chef had a recipe for pizza -- but it was \"essentially a cake,\" says Zancani, made with almond and sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content 21 places to go in 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen pizza became pizza\\r\\n\\r\\nPizza: Samuel Morse was not a fan.

In 1760, fresh tomatoes arrived in Naples -- and what we recognize as pizza hit the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content How to make pizza dough at home\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors to the city started spreading the word about this novel street food. Alexandre Dumas, author of \"The Three Musketeers.\" wrote excitedly about the different toppings, while Carlo Collodi, Pinocchio\\'s creator, railed against them. Samuel Morse, inventor of Morse Code, hated pizza. He seems to have been a minority, though -- the Bourbon king of Naples, Ferdinand, even had a brick pizza oven installed in his summer residence. \"It was a food of the poor but he obviously enjoyed it,\" says Zancani.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came that breakthrough moment we\\'ve all heard about. The king and queen of the newly unified Italy came to visit Naples in 1889 and Queen Margarita was keen to try the local specialty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She contacted the best pizzaiolo [pizza-maker] in Naples and he offered her three types: white with pork fat, caciocavallo cheese and basil; olive oil and anchovies; and tomatoes, mozzarella and basil,\" says Zancani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The story goes the queen chose the third because it reminded her of the flag of Italy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pizza Margherita was born.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, it took off in a really big way,\" says Zancani.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaples, still pizza-central\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best pizzaioli have the magic touch.

Pizza e Scuola AVPN\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce it had earned the royal seal of approval, pizza was officially here to stay, but rather than it being Queen Margherita who sparked the global trend, it was Italy\\'s poorest immigrants who popularized it around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginning of the 19th century saw mass migration from the south of Italy to the United States. And, of course, they took their recipes with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Americans say pizza was created by Neapolitans but given to the world by Americans. I agree,\" says Diego Zancani.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s that adaptation of pizza that appeals to Christine Ristaino , senior lecturer in Italian language and literature at Emory University with a special interest in the cultural history of food, especially noodles\\r\\n\\r\\nShe compares the evolution of pizza in the US to the film \"Big Night,\" in which two first-generation Italian immigrants (played by Tony Shalhoub and Stanley Tucci) open a restaurant on the Jersey Shore and disagree as to whether to adapt their food to American tastes.\\r\\n\\r\\nRistaino also mentions another key community in the popularization of pizza: American troops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the Americans came to Italy at the end of the war, they found they loved pizza, so they brought it back to the US,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Before that, it had mainly been located in Italian-American culture, but after the war it became a dish that other people would eat. The different types of pizza in the US developed because of the needs and populations in the different areas. There are different populations in New York from Chicago. The Italians took pizza from Naples and adapted it to the people in the area. People are very talented at adapting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey\\'re talented at innovating, too. Zancani -- who remembers eating pizza while a student in London as \"the cheapest way to survive\" -- says that the American innovation of freezing pizza dough in the 1950s was what took the food all over the world. He reckons that, despite it being about Naples, Dean Martin\\'s 1953 hit \"That\\'s Amore\" helped cement it as an all-American food.\\r\\n\\r\\nForeign pizzas are \\'travesties\\' -- but that\\'s okay\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do you like yours? Pizza e Scuola AVPN\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while pizza was conquering the globe, there was one country where its appeal was more limited: Italy itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pizza remained a Neapolitan thing for many years -- before World War II it was barely known north of Rome, and it wasn\\'t an immediate success. It came with the internal migration of the 1950s and 1960s,\" says Zancani.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, of course, that has changed -- pizza is as popular in Italy as everywhere else, with the Roman variant (a thinner base) vying with the Naples original.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you think the Italians are horrified about the global bastardization of their creation, think again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s what happens to all foods -- they get adapted to local tastes,\" says Zancani, who admits his favorite is the Neapolitan original.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The American style is just different -- same with the ingredients. The Hawaiian pizza with pineapple is a weird concept, but if you like it, good. Yes, it\\'s a travesty in a way, but most food in a way is a travesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZancani, whose favorite pizza is a Quattro Stagioni (Four Seasons) on a Neapolitan base, says that in the UK, his vote for good pizza goes to the Franco Manca mini-chain. Ristaino loves one called \"Rucola\" from Sapori di Napoli pizzeria in Decatur, Georgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd not even Antonio Pace of the AVPN is angry about deep-dish pizza.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t do anything but respect anyone who makes any kind of pizza with dedication and sacrifice,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve never said that Neapolitan pizza is the best; we just reiterate that it\\'s different.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our strong point is simplicity and we\\'re happy that in recent years, various types of American pizza are evolving from products which were rich in ingredients and not always well put together, to a product with high quality and well selected ingredients.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Traveling to Italy during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to make an authentic Neapolitan pizza\\r\\n\\r\\nAVPN has been training pizza-makers since 1984. Pizza e Scuola AVPN\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want real Naples-style pizza, though, the AVPN is on hand to help. Since 1984 they\\'ve been training and vetting pizza-makers around the world, accrediting their wares as authentic Naples-style.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the time, pizzerias in the rest of Italy and abroad were starting to develop, and we realized that their product was very different from ours. Our fear was that having this type of pizza spreading through the world could see the original Neapolitan recipe forgotten,\" says Pace, who loves the traditional toppings, like marinara and, his favorite, Margherita.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir solution? Founding the association and imposing strict rules for pizza made by their affiliates.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the AVPN\\'s rules for making true Neapolitan-style pizza stretch to 14 pages, and cover everything from the flour and temperature of the water that goes into the dough, to fermentation time, shaping the pizza, ingredient-sourcing and cooking instructions -- just 60-90 seconds on a slab of 380-430 C, or 716-806 F.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould-be pizzaioli must also submit videos of their pizza-making process from start to finish -- from making and shaping the dough, to adding the toppings and baking it. Once they\\'ve passed the first stage, they\\'re mystery-shopped by an instructor or a verified pizzaiolo -- who pretends to be a regular client and tastes the pizza.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, 854 pizzerias in 52 countries are members of the association. \"We\\'re particularly proud of the latest affiliation -- a pizzeria in Egypt run by an ex-student of ours,\" says Pace. \"It\\'s the first in Africa, and means we\\'re now present on five continents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGo to Naples and you\\'ll likely be told that no pizza outside the city will ever taste the same -- something to do with the air, they say, or the water. But although Pace suggests visitors come to Naples and wander the alleys of the historical center, smelling the freshly baked dough in the air (and even taking a day-long pizza-making course with the AVPN), he says that the popularly held belief isn\\'t correct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Essentially a true Neapolitan pizza is made with simple ingredients: water, flour, salt and yeast, with no added fats or sugars. It should be left to rise for at least 12 hours and is cooked in a wood-fired oven for 60-90 seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve always said that the quality of a true Neapolitan pizza isn\\'t linked either to the dialect or the nationality of the pizzaiolo, but to a production method that doesn\\'t have secrets -- although many people would like you to think it does,\" he says.',\n",

       " '(CNN) â\\x80\\x94 When Sweden\\'s GÃ¶teborg Film Festival announced a contest inviting a film fan to spend seven days watching movies, alone, on an isolated lighthouse island, Swedish nurse Lisa Enroth took notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth was intrigued by the atmospheric short film produced by the festival to advertise the opportunity, in which a woman arrives on an island under thunderous skies, ready to begin a solo cinematic odyssey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was brilliantly done,\" Enroth, 41, told CNN Travel . She decided to apply to give herself a break from her relentless work in an emergency ward in her hometown of SkÃ¶vde.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough she\\'s passionate about her job, Enroth said its demanding nature meant that the prospect of time alone by the ocean -- without a cell phone and with only the endless sea, limitless sky and an abundance of movies for company -- had an obvious allure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seemed like a good idea at the time,\" Enroth told CNN on January 27, just after she found out she\\'d been chosen from some 12,000 applicants to spend a week on the Swedish island of HamneskÃ¤r.\\r\\n\\r\\nHamneskÃ¤r is situated off the coast of Marstrand in western Sweden, home to an imposing cast iron lighthouse called Pater Noster, meaning \"Our Father\" in Latin -- a reference to the \"Lord\\'s Prayer\" often uttered by sailors navigating the rough seas around the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Enroth knew of Pater Noster, having spent a year studying in nearby Gothenberg, she\\'d never been there before and was both nervous and excited about the experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst impressions\\r\\n\\r\\nl e v a r t\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 30, Enroth boarded a tiny boat with a single helmsman to begin her journey to the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer heart was pounding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ride out to the island, she says, was stunning -- sea, sky and snow stretched out in front of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd her first view of Pater Noster lighthouse, silhouetted in the distance, was unforgettable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first impression of the island? Beautiful, small, just tranquil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArriving on the island and getting her first glimpse of the lighthouse was an incredible experience for Lisa Enroth. Courtesy Erik Nissen Johanssen\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Film festival invites fans to watch movies alone on a Swedish island\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft alone, Enroth closed the door to her lighthouse cottage and sat down on the couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, she heard the sound of the boat leaving, engine roaring. Then, nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was so silent. It was like someone turned off the sound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nListening harder, she slowly picked up on the wind whistling, birds swooping over the lighthouse and the waves crashing on the rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth put on her warmest clothes and decided to survey her surroundings, walking the perimeter of the island and climbing the 130 something stairs to the top of Pater Noster.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took deep breaths, and readied to enjoy the week ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content What it\\'s like to be a lighthouse keeper\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in isolation\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth enjoyed a week of movie-watching without her cellphone as a distraction. Courtesy Erik Nissen Johansen\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth normally lives alone, but her frontline healthcare job means she spends a lot of time interacting with people on a day-to-day basis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was really looking forward to just trying to reflect and pause for a bit,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nGÃ¶teborg Film Festival Artistic Director Jonas Holmberg told CNN Travel that for safety reasons, there was one other person on the island, but they were to keep their distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lighthouse cabin which became Enroth\\'s home for the week was recently renovated by design agency Stylt, so it was not only stylish, but well equipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmberg said that a soft bed and good food were part of the deal. \"This is not about surviving,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a movie fan, Enroth had seen all the lighthouse-set movies that quickly descend into horror, and that did play on her mind. Especially because she\\'s afraid of the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat first night, after the sun set illuminating the clouds in a copper haze, the island was soon shrouded in darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth tried to sleep, but struggled, her ears attune to any unusual sound in the cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island of HamneskÃ¤r, nicknamed Pater Noster, in Sweden. Courtesy Erik Nissen Johanssen\\r\\n\\r\\nBut waking up to the sunrise made the sleepness night quickly fade into the background and she decided to make rising with the sun part of her island routine.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach morning she watched the sun come up, and then ate breakfast in her kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sunlight is unbelievable,\" Enroth says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an on-site gym, which Enroth used every day -- although nothing beat running up and down the lighthouse a few times a day to get her heart pumping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After I went up the first time, I went down again, and I had to stay there for a while because my head was just spinning,\" she laughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in isolation, Enroth\\'s imagination did start to run wild. Courtesy Erik Nissen Johansen\\r\\n\\r\\nBack on the ground, Enroth would tuck into a second breakfast and get ready to enjoy the day, delving into the GÃ¶teborg film festival schedule but also painting, walking and creating a video diary.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth had left her cellphone and laptop on dry land, as instructed. Being without them was a freeing experience, \"a relief,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was great not being attached to your phone, and just watching a movie without the distraction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnable to Google anything, she realized how used we\\'ve become to having all the answers at our fingertips. In her video diary for Day 5, Enroth talked about some of the questions that had floated into her mind that she\\'d had to just leave be (\"Where do lobsters sleep? How do they sleep?\")\\r\\n\\r\\nUnable to check the news, or read updates from loved ones, Enroth\\'s movie-fueled imagination began to run wild. She worried that coronavirus might have worsened further in her absence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking about the apocalypse,\" she says. \"Your mind starts to make up things, \\'What if this happened? And this and that could have happened...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProducing the video diary was also an new experience for her -- Enroth has a Facebook account, but says she\\'s not much of a social media user and had little experience of filming herself speaking to the camera.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think I ever got used to it,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Enroth did enjoy having an outlet for her thoughts. One of the strangest things, she says, was watching films and not being able to discuss them with anyone afterward, whether in person or online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had to try to process [the movies] by myself, and that means they stayed with me for a long time. And I\\'ve never dreamed so much strange stuff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHighlights of the film program for Enroth included \"A Song Called Hate,\" a documentary about the Eurovision Song Contest and the Taiwanese drama \"Days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth enjoyed being able to fully sink into her movie watching. She became aware that when she watched movies back home, even ones she was really enjoying, it was easy to reach for her phone, or get distracted by something in the house. Not so on the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, she reckons she watched about 30 feature-length movies, along with a handful of shorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content They met on an airplane to Egypt then fell in love\\r\\n\\r\\nLessons from isolation\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing alone on the island suited Enroth, but she stresses that it was enjoyable because it was her prerogative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m thinking about is all the people who don\\'t choose to be alone, and they are forced to be alone -- and that is so much harder than what I did. What I did was just enjoyable,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnroth made it back home on February 7, and was returning back to work, on a night shift, the following day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe says being back in the hospital will be a grounding experience, and she\\'s aware island life will quickly recede into the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I also think that the island has taught me not to rush so much,\" says Enroth.',\n",

       " '(CNN) â\\x80\\x94 In September 1970 Jocelyne Nowaski was working as chief flight attendant on a Pan American World Airways flight from Paris to New York when her life changed forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her two years at Pan Am the 23-year-old had made friends across the globe, served celebrities including Beatle Ringo Starr and featured with her coworkers in the pages of Paris Match magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\nPan Am layovers were spent exploring Morocco, on safaris in Nairobi, galloping on horseback on the beaches of Barbados, swimming in Liberia, and browsing the jewelry stalls of Beirut.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she recalls it, her career happened almost by accident. Jocelyne had majored in biology at New York City\\'s College of Mount St. Vincent, intending to become a doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut right before graduation, a friend knocked on her dorm room and told her the luxury airline was interviewing for flight crew at its famous Manhattan skyscraper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer friend insisted they should both try out, for a laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\" agreed Jocelyne. She found herself recalling the glossy commercials: \"Your Pan Am stewardess knows her way around the world like you know your way around the block.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo become a Pan Am flight attendant, candidates needed a college degree, and to speak a second language. Jocelyne\\'s mother was French-Canadian, so she ticked both boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was hired -- her friend wasn\\'t -- and within weeks of graduating, followed by rigorous training, Jocelyne was working her first trip aboard a Boeing 727 to Nassau, in the Bahamas.\\r\\n\\r\\nJocelyne never became a doctor and never looked back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the best job,\" she tells CNN Travel today. \"It wasn\\'t a job; it was a labor of love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1970, love was the last thing on Jocelyne\\'s mind. She\\'d ended a relationship with a pilot six months previously, and she was having a blast exploring the world with her girlfriends. Her focus was on her career.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat fall, increased worries about airplane hijackings following the events of September 6, 1970 led to plans for a formalized air security program\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the interim, fire-arm qualified individuals from organizations like the CIA and FBI were seconded and assigned onto flights.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraveling back to JFK from Paris in mid-September, Jocelyne recalls she and her crew were told that two security officers would be joining them: one in economy and one in first class.\\r\\n\\r\\nJocelyne in her uniform, including her gold wings. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\\r\\n\\r\\nJocelyne was heading up the economy cabin as purser, and they were readying for takeoff. All the passengers had boarded the Boeing 707, a narrow-body airliner used by Pan Am from 1958.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the security officers were late, much to Jocelyne\\'s annoyance. She rolled her eyes even harder when she learned it was because they\\'d been buying Parisian scarves to impress girls back home.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally arriving on board, the economy cabin security officer introduced himself. His name was Tyler Harding, smartly dressed in a suit and tie, a tan overcoat over one arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight away, Jocelyne recalls, she was struck by his charm and good looks, but she wasn\\'t interested in a relationship and didn\\'t think he was seriously interested in her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was working with some Swedish girls and the Swedish girls were absolutely stunning,\" she laughs. \"I wouldn\\'t even think of competing against them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTyler took his seat on the second to back row and the aircraft took off, bidding the Paris lights goodbye and setting off across the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nAir marshals are supposed to blend in, so Jocelyne served Tyler as she would any other passenger, but unlike every other passenger he tried to strike up a conversation every time she came over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was very flirty,\" Jocelyne recalls. \"I was not, because I thought: \\'Oh, he\\'s just doing this because he wants to talk to my colleagues.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis suspicion -- plus the scarves -- made her wary. She kept her tone terse, even teasing him about his drink choice. \"He was very pleasant, in spite of my being snarky,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the aircraft started cruising over the ocean, Jocelyne and her coworkers began their dinner service. Tyler continued to engage her in conversation whenever she walked by.\\r\\n\\r\\nJocelyne and her Pan Am coworkers enjoyed their layovers in destinations across the world. Here they are on a safari in Nairobi. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter she\\'d served the food, Jocelyne did her usual overview of the cabin. While walking down the aisles she glanced at Tyler. He wasn\\'t looking at her at that moment. But she felt herself stop in her tracks, struck suddenly with a thought: \"I wonder what it\\'ll be like to be married to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe recalls quickly shaking herself out of it. \"What are you thinking? You don\\'t even know this man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jocelyne couldn\\'t explain it, even to herself. In that moment she\\'d been struck by this strange certainty that a future with Tyler was not only likely, but inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometime later, she was sitting up top of the plane on the jump seat, when Tyler sat down next to her. At which point he asked her out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t date passengers,\" she said. \"And you\\'re probably married anyway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTyler pointed out he wasn\\'t exactly a passenger, and when Jocelyne still looked unimpressed, he fished out his passport, which back then listed dependents -- or in his case, absence of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was 29, the black print said, and a resident of Alexandria, Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nJocelyne was relieved, but still wary about dating someone she barely knew. Apparently sensing this, Tyler relented and returned to his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the airplane approached Long Island, edging closer to New York City, it was time for Jocelyne to do the last drinks service, carrying a teapot in one hand and a coffee pot in the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got to Tyler, who requested coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And as I\\'m pouring the coffee in his cup, he looked up at me with those amazing blue eyes,\" recalls Jocelyne. \"Naturally, I poured the coffee into his cup. Unfortunately, at the same time I poured tea into his lap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMortified, Jocelyne grabbed cloth napkins from the back of the plane and handed them to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTyler told her not to worry, but was laughing. \"Now you have to go out with me,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlushing, Jocelyne dodged the question and went to confide in her friend Mala, who was the purser in first class.\\r\\n\\r\\nJocelyne Harding â\\x80\\x9cAs I\\'m pouring the coffee in his cup, he looked up at me with those amazing blue eyes. Naturally, I poured the coffee into his cup.

He was nowhere to be seen as the party got into full swing. Then the doorbell rang.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Tyler, with his fellow security officer in tow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It took my breath away. It really did,\" says Jocelyne.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight away, the pair went to the kitchen and started chatting over cocktails.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was leaning against Mala\\'s range with my back to the ring. He was standing in front of me and we must have talked for about three hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair discussed their childhoods -- hers in New York and his in California -- their families, dreams, travels, careers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing off the table was the true nature of his job -- Tyler couldn\\'t reveal he worked for the CIA. She found that out later.\\r\\n\\r\\nTyler and Jocelyne ignored the hubbub of the party around them, chatting incessantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the end of the evening, he looked at me, and he said: \\'Will you marry me?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer answer, she says, slipped out instinctively, in a moment of clarity and assurance. \"I said, \\'Yes.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Mystery of 60-year-old Alaska tourist photos is solved\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobe spanning romance\\r\\n\\r\\nJocelyne and Tyler in December 1970, a few months after they met.

Ostensibly, it was under the excuse he needed to collect his car, but they both knew that wasn\\'t the real reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two started dating, spending all their time together when they weren\\'t traveling for work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat October, just a few weeks after they met, Tyler asked Jocelyne to marry him -- again.

Around 41% of those were from mainland China -- a figure that was expected to keep rising.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the outbreak of Covid-19 has cast a shadow on the 20th anniversary of the Mini Three Links this year, as ties have been suspended since February 2020, with direct ferries and flights canceled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Incoming visitors via \\'Mini Three Links\\' plunged by 93.96% in 2020,\" says Ting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local travel market was brought to a standstill as well due to the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a big blow to Kinmen\\'s tourism industry in the first few months.

But despite all the cleavage shots, \"Bitter Rice\" threw the spotlight on a job that had been, until then, thankless.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery summer, from May to July, until the 1960s (and even 1970s in some places) thousands of working-class women would make their way to the Po Valley in northern Italy. They were there to work as \"mondine\" -- field weeders, clearing space for the rice plants to grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was backbreaking work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They would start very early and work till mid-afternoon, in this leaning-over position,\" says Dr Flora Derounian , lecturer in modern languages at the University of Sussex, who specializes in women\\'s work and oral histories.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They were knee-high in water, exposed to the sun, and there was a high prevalence of disease, including malaria. One senator who made a speech on their conditions [in 1953] likened them to one of Dante\\'s circles of hell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn being taught the technique, Silvana Mangano (who, incidentally, was the grandmother of US TV chef Giada de Laurentiis) is said to have exclaimed: \"Like this, for eight hours? I wouldn\\'t do this work even for a million a day!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Derounian says there was far more to the mondine than feeding the nation. Largely left wing, they were some of the only workers to successfully protest against the Fascist government, and carried out important work as part of the anti-Nazi resistance during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They did a lot of things like hiding partisans, and passing on messages and materials,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content The Italian town where they eat 500-year-old meals\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were often passed over during post-war efforts to recognize the partisans. And sometimes, that passing over came from their own families -- even when they\\'d worked in the resistance together (men would do active combat and women would hide fighters, provide food and pass on messages).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was one case where the authorities came to give \\'tessere\\' [cards of recognition for the war effort] to members of one family. The husband said, no, just one in the family is enough -- I\\'ll have mine. The woman -- a \\'mondina\\' -- never got her tessera,\" says Derounian.\\r\\n\\r\\nScandal and starpower\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly\\'s rice belt follows the River Po across the north of the country, from Piedmont to Veneto. G. GNEMMI/De Agostini Editorial/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nSo how did a humble grain get to play center stage in Italy\\'s anti-Fascist resistance? It\\'s thought that rice was first domesticated in China\\'s Yangtze River valley around 10,000 years ago. Before that, locals had harvested wild rice for a couple more thousand years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romans imported it to use as a spice, and there are records that in the Middle Ages it was still being used like that -- ground, to thicken sauces and dishes such as blancmange, says Diego Zancani, emeritus professor of medieval and modern languages at Oxford University and author of \" How We Fell in Love with Italian Food .\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRice cultivation in Italy came a little later, he says, probably entering from India. And although tradition has Italy\\'s rice industry starting in Lombardy in the 15th century -- in 1450, Francesco Sforza, the ruler of Milan, wrote a letter ordering straw hats made of \"paglia di riso,\" or rice straw -- he says that there\\'s evidence that it was already being cultivated in Ferrara , now part of Emilia Romagna.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither way, production revolved around Italy\\'s \"rice belt\" -- the dank, marshy land around the Po river, running west to east across Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and Veneto in the north of Italy. The country swiftly became Europe\\'s biggest producer of rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 600 years later, it still is.\\r\\n\\r\\nDa Vinci and a thieving priest\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Italy\\'s rice belt is mechanized, and worked by individual farmers. Hermes Images/AGF/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that it happened without scandal. In 1839, a Jesuit priest, Padre Calleri, returned from missionary work in the Philippines carrying the seeds of 43 different rice types, which he\\'d stolen. He brought them back to the Vercelli area in Piedmont, where the Count of Cavour, Camillo Benso, enthusiastically promoted the new varieties, building a canal system to create what would become Italy\\'s modern rice sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenso went on to become the first Prime Minister of a newly unified Italy, but he wasn\\'t the most famous name to be involved with the rice trade. Leonardo da Vinci was famously employed by the Sforza family to create Milan\\'s canal system in 1482, which would create a water route from Lake Como to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid he also work on irrigation for the family\\'s rice fields? It\\'s more than possible, says Zancani. \"Chronologically Leonardo fits,\" he says. \"He went to Milan as an engineer, and Francesco Sforza had been interested in rice 30 years earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In his \\'domanda,\\' or CV, he wrote that he was an expert in hydraulics and waterways, and he participated in a huge increase in canals, which improved production in the Po Valley. So it\\'s not a mistake to say there\\'s a connection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe birth of risotto\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Minestra di riso\" or rice soup, quickly became a popular dish. Shutterstock/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern Italians took rice to their hearts, and it swiftly became an integral ingredient in regional cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From them on we have early recipes of \\'minestra di riso\\' -- rice soup,\" says Zancani.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenaissance-era courts would gift sacks of rice to each other -- there are records of the Sforza family of Milan and the Este of Ferrara indulging in rice-based diplomacy. Cristoforo di Messisbugo, the Renaissance celebrity chef and Lucrezia Borgia\\'s master of ceremonies, included rice dishes in his famous recipe book\\r\\n\\r\\nNot risotto, though.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Risotto as we know it was probably developed in the 19th century,\" says Zancani.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople then immediately took to it. The dish has become synonymous with northern Italy, with all the rice belt regions knocking out their own variations. Veneto\\'s seafood twists get an honorable mention, but ultimately, the most famous of all has to be risotto alla milanese, where the rice is swirled in parmesan, saffron, wine, and little else. In the 1960s, novelist Carlo Emilio Gadda wrote a famous homage to the dish -- part recipe, part love letter -- in which he specified his preferences right down to the best shop in Milan to buy saffron from, and insisting on butter from Lodi.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not even a creamy risotto alla milanese could help rice take off lower down Italy\\'s boot. Sicily has its rice balls, of course, and there is some cultivation in Sardinia, too. But Italy\\'s rice belt has remained firmly around the Po since the 1400s. Below Emilia Romagna, you\\'ll be hard pressed to find rice dishes on the menu. Further south, it\\'s all about pasta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat special rice alchemy\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly is still Europe\\'s biggest rice producer. OLIVIER MORIN/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, up in the north, the rice belt Italians are pushing the rice boundaries. At Ristorante Ponterosso , a restaurant in Monteveglio, Emilia Romagna, chef Massimo Ratti is known region-wide for his inventive dishes. Perhaps his most famous is Risotto Luigi XII: rice with lamb, clams, potatoes, pomegranate, orange, chicory, nutmeg and crushed olives. Like the multi-flavor dishes of the Renaissance court of nearby Ferrara, it shouldn\\'t work -- but it does.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rice is part of our culture,\" he says. \"We\\'re the best producers in Europe because we have the best conditions, but we also like it. The cooking of our \\'mamma\\' and \\'nonna\\' is always our reference point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s easy to cook rice badly, he says -- and it\\'s easy to lose the taste of the rice. To keep it, he says you need to \"toast\" it, while raw, on a high heat, \"until it becomes a bit dark, almost caramelized.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, he says, you should add a couple of spoonfuls of broth, cool it on a marble surface, and then get going with the sauce. It sounds like alchemy -- and he says it preserves the starch in the rice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After that I can do five or six risottos, because I\\'ve already treated the starch. Gorgonzola and banana, duck and pinenuts, veggies with goats cheese, kiwi...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis other famous risottos include melon with smoked pecorino, and risotto with pumpkin, chestnuts and pomegranate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People who like rice, like rice,\" he says simply, adding that carnaroli is his top pick of rice variant for a good risotto.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new risotto-friendly variants\\r\\n\\r\\nMondine in the rice fields of Piedmont, circa 1920-1950. American Stock Archive/Archive Photos/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThey certainly do like rice. In the past century, the Italians have worked hard on creating their ideal kinds of the grain. Ratti\\'s beloved carnaroli was \"launched\" in 1945 -- a medium-grained cross between vialone and lencino, named after its inventor, Emiliano Carnaroli, former president of the Ente Nazionale Risi , or National Rice Organization (yes, Italy has a National Rice Organization).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high-starch arborio and vialone nano (itself a cross of vialone and nano) are the other popular risotto rices, the starch making for a creamy final dish. Both originated in the Italian rice belt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as we pick up our packet of carnaroli in the supermarket, it\\'s worth remembering that the mondine -- and their hard lives -- are the reason we\\'re buying those Italian rice types today.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome were local women; others were seasonal workers, usually from northern Italy, who came for the weeding months. They worked the rice fields until the 1960s, and even the 1970s, when pesticides and then mechanization came into force.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content The tragedy behind Italy\\'s famous pasta dish\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal women lived at home, but seasonal workers were put up in huge dormitories. At Tenuta Colombara , in the Vercelli region of Piedmont, where risotto with frogs is a typical dish, the 1920s dormitory where up to 200 women slept has been turned into a museum dedicated to the life of the mondine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a tough job but it was of fundamental importance,\" says Anna Rondalino, owner of the farm, which, today, produces one of Italy\\'s most chichi rices, Acquerello , said to be beloved of chefs including Massimo Bottura.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aged carnaroli invented by her father, Piero, in 1991, it has a mammoth 20-step production process, which includes reattaching the nutrient-packed germ to the rice grain (making it as nutritious as wholegrain rice); using a specially delicate \"helix\" method to whiten the rice; and culminates in it being aged for anything from one to seven years.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife in the fields\\r\\n\\r\\nRice fields in the province of Novara, Piedmont. G. GNEMMI/De Agostini Editorial/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mondine at Tenuta Colombara ate \"panissa\" -- rice with meat and beans -- says Rondalino. They were paid in rice, too, says Flora Derounian (who\\'s not referring to Tenuta Colombara, but has studied the mondine in general). A scene in \"Riso Amaro\" shows the women being paid one scoop of rice for every day they worked. Female children would also work in the fields, and the women would have their babies brought to them to breastfeed at lunchtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft-wing politics ruled the rice fields, perhaps because of the tough conditions. Many mondine were members of their local communist parties, and, Derounian says, \"they were always asking for better conditions, better food.\" There are documented strikes under fascist and Nazi rule. \"They were one of the only workforces to protest under fascism and gain concessions,\" says Derounian -- including better pay, shorter working days and the right to bring food into the fields for their break times. And when they joined wider protests, the mondine would be put at the front, especially during the Nazi occupation, she says -- \"they were less likely to be arrested.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt didn\\'t always work. One woman was killed at a protest in 1949. Maria Margotti -- a former member of the resistance -- was 34 when she was shot, protesting for agricultural workers rights in Molinella, Emilia Romagna. Thirty other people were injured when police fired at the 6,000-strong crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nConflict and community\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rice fields line the area around the River Po, known for its cypress trees. MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t all female solidarity, of course. There was friction between the local women and the \"forestiere\" or \"foreigners\", who came from outside the area. If local women were striking for better pay, landowners would bring in outsiders to work. \"It caused a lot of problems,\" says Derounian. The famous fight scene in \"Riso Amaro,\" in which the women wrestle in the muddy water, is more than about titillation, she says -- they\\'re fighting over \"scab\" workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, she says, when the mondine think about their old lives, it\\'s with affection. \"There\\'s definitely a rose-tinted memory -- they talk about a sense of community, solidarity, participation in the resistance and communism. That has really overtaken the memory of how difficult it was,\" says Derounian.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey would sing as they worked, and even today, there are mondine choirs around northern Italy -- some with former workers still in them, but others made up of relatives and local women, keeping their history alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt all stopped when pesticides and mechanization began. From the 1960s, the mondine began to be pushed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content How Italy changed Stanley Tucci forever\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a really turbulent process, because they were freelancers. Farmers who had mechanized would put up signs with a figure of a mondina crossed out,\" says Derounian.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they didn\\'t go down without a fight. \"Sometimes they would reverse protest and go to work without being invited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy that point, the mondine had gone from relative national obscurity, known only in the rice belt, to international stardom, thanks to \"Riso Amaro.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while its hypersexualized camerawork and birth of a bombshell in the shape of Silvana Mangano galvanized a nation, the film was making a serious point about the working conditions of the mondine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, this was a neorealist film -- Italy\\'s postwar genre focusing on the living conditions of the poorest members of society -- and director Giuseppe de Santis was a paid up member of the PCI, or Italian Communist Party. He\\'d also fought as a partisan against the Nazis in World War II\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they needed sex appeal to get the film funded. And, in the shape of Mangano, they got it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilvana Mangano with Vittorio Gassman in \"Riso Amaro.\" Lux Film/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no other female workforce apart from prostitutes or models that have really captured the imagination in the postwar period,\" says Derounian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I think that\\'s come at the cost of them being highly sexualized. In one [oral history] interview, one woman said that after the film they were thought of as prostitutes, which wasn\\'t fair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mondine did take one inspiration from the film though -- fashion. They swapped their long weeding skirts for the shorts worn by Silvana and her companions in the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nDerounian says that the film -- and its mass market appeal -- caused a \"massive debate in the Communist Party over whether it was a sellout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ultimately, she said, the film \"put rice on the map as a national product, and it catapulted the mondine into everybody\\'s minds.\"',\n",

       " '(CNN) â\\x80\\x94 If you\\'re daydreaming of future travels while stuck at home during the pandemic, why fantasize about the beaches of Bali or the canals of Venice when vacationing in space could be in your future?\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 2019 , Californian company the Gateway Foundation released plans for a cruise ship-style hotel that could one day float above the Earth\\'s atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen called the Von Braun Station, this futuristic concept -- comprised of 24 modules connected by elevator shafts that make up a rotating wheel orbiting the Earth -- was scheduled to be fully operational by 2027.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast forward a couple years and the hotel has a new name -- Voyager Station -- and it\\'s set to be built by Orbital Assembly Corporation, a new construction company run by former pilot John Blincow, who also heads up the Gateway Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a recent interview with CNN Travel, Blincow explained there had been some Covid-related delays, but construction on the space hotel is expected to begin in 2026, and a sojourn in space could be a reality by 2027.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re trying to make the public realize that this golden age of space travel is just around the corner. It\\'s coming. It\\'s coming fast,\" said Blincow.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hotel like no other\\r\\n\\r\\nSpace tourism is viewed as travel\\'s next frontier. Orbital Assembly Corporation\\r\\n\\r\\nRenderings of what the hotel might look like suggest an interior not dissimilar to a luxury Earth-bound hotel, just with some pretty specatcular out-of-this-world views.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the initial designs premiered a couple years ago, Tim Alatorre, senior design architect at Orbital Assembly Corporation told CNN Travel the hotel\\'s aesthetic was a direct response to the Stanley Kubrick movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" -- which he called \"almost a blueprint of what not to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think the goal of Stanley Kubrick was to highlight the divide between technology and humanity and so, purposefully, he made the stations and the ships very sterile and clean and alien.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, Alatorre and his team want to bring a slice of earth to space via warm suites and chic bars and restaurants. Guests might be in space, but they can still enjoy regular beds and showers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s not to say the hotel will ignore the novelty of being in space altogether. There are plans to serve traditional \"space food\" -- like freeze dried ice cream -- in the hotel\\'s restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlus there will be recreational activities on offer that \"highlight the fact that you\\'re able to do things that you can\\'t do on Earth,\" according to Alatorre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because of the weightlessness and the reduced gravity, you\\'ll be able to jump higher, be able to lift things, be able to run in ways that you can\\'t on Earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Designs revealed for incredible new space hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does it work?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal is for Voyager Station to be operational in 2027. Orbital Assembly Corporation\\r\\n\\r\\nSo how exactly would the physics of a space hotel work?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlatorre told CNN Travel that the rotating wheel would work to create a simulated gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The station rotates, pushing the contents of the station out to the perimeter of the station, much in the way that you can spin a bucket of water -- the water pushes out into the bucket and stays in place,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the center of the station there\\'s no artificial gravity, Alatorre explained, but as you move down the outside of the station, the feeling of gravity increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rendering offers a glimpse at what the space hotel could look like. Orbital Assembly Corporation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hotel\\'s original name was chosen because the concept was inspired by 60-year-old designs from Wernher von Braun, an aerospace engineer who pioneered rocket technology, first in Germany and later in the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile living in Germany, von Braun was involved in the Nazi rocket development program, so naming the space hotel after him was a controversial choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was partly why the name\\'s been changed, Blincow told CNN Travel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The station is not really about him. It\\'s based on his design, and we like his contributions towards science and space,\" Blincow said. \"But you know, Voyager Station is so much more than that. It is the stuff in the future. And we want a name that doesn\\'t have those attachments to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSpace tourism is becoming an increasingly hot topic, and there are several companies trying to make it happen -- from Virgin Galactic to Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaceX\\'s StarShip system could help get Voyager Station off the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We cannot call SpaceX our partner, but in the future we look forward to working with them,\" Blincow told a recent live event promoting Orbital Assembly, advising viewers to \"hang tight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now, the space hotel isn\\'t advertising a room rate, but expect it to come with a pretty hefty price tag attached.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgin Galactic, for example, plans to launch passengers into sub-orbital space at $250,000 per person, per trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever the team behind Voyager Station have said they\\'re hoping to eventually make a stay at the hotel equivalent to \"a trip on a cruise or a trip to Disneyland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Balloon trips to the edge of space by 2021\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Starship culture\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Voyager Station is perhaps the flashiest of Orbital\\'s designs, it\\'s actually just one facet of their space ambitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team is also hoping to build research stations, and spark space tourism and commerce opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re designing the tools and machines right now that can build these structures very quickly,\" Blincow told CNN Travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team imagine government or private companies might use modules for training crews \"heading to Mars, the Moon and beyond,\" as Alatorre outlined at the 2021 live event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next stage in getting the Voyager Station off the ground is bringing more investors into the mix, and continuing with tests on the ground.',\n",

Tourism is our life; most of us work just during the summer months but we can\\'t complain,\" says Marco Spisso, who co-runs Vulcano\\'s popular mud bath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Winters are usually quiet, so on that front the pandemic hasn\\'t revolutionized our lives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to legend, Greek God of fire Hephaestus vented his anger over wife Aphrodite\\'s betrayals in Vulcano, so it seems fitting that the island is full of bubbling mud baths with healing hot springs and underwater sea fumaroles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a place where sulfur gases ooze out of black, red and yellow stone walls and pavements where tourists typically gather to catch the ferry. Tiny heat clouds can be seen rising from the rocks here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 300 or so people who live in Vulcano all year are continuing as normal. They spend their time fishing, walking, fixing their houses, meeting each other for quick chats (wearing masks) at the local bar and relaxing at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nShuttered shops aren\\'t unusual for this time of year, says Spisso, who often goes for a swim down at the volcanic beach in front of his old lookout tower home.\\r\\n\\r\\nVulcano has reasonably warm temperatures all year, and the constant volcanic activity helps to keep the sea water pleasantly mild.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We lead a peaceful life, relatively serene, and we feel safe compared to many other people living elsewhere,\" adds Spisso.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are regular Covid checks at Milazzo harbor from where the ferries depart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the island is very close to mainland Sicily, which has been hit hard by the pandemic, it\\'s still managed to remain free of the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarco Giorgianni, who is mayor of the entire Aeolian archipelago except for the island of Salina, enforced stricter Covid rules back in October by limiting island-hopping between the seven isles, and this move appears to have been successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilicudi\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islanders of Filicudi are grateful to live in \"another world\" during these uncertain times. Silvia Marchetti\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island of Filicudi, one of the wildest and farthest out among the Aeolian islands, has also done well at keeping Covid at bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerries often find it difficult to dock here due to the rough sea conditions. While this was a frustration for locals in the past, the missing connection is now mostly viewed as a good thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIslanders feel lucky to live in such seclusion, far from the chaos and confusion brought about by coronavirus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s an ugly moment for humanity but I am happy to live here, it\\'s like being in another world,\" says Peppino Taranto, a resident of Filicudi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re privileged. Social distancing is guaranteed. Thanks to our warm winter climate my wife and I often enjoy having dinner outside under starry skies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLocals can while away the hours relaxing on typical Aeolian-style panoramic terraces made of columns covered with bright bougainvilleas and majolica benches with stunning sea views.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilicudi has just one fishing village, Pecorini a Mare, connected to the harbor by one dusty road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island\\'s steep donkey trails and stone paths lead to bright cottages and its black, green and red cliffs contain labyrinths of grottoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPietro Anastasi, owner of panoramic La Canna restaurant and hotel, has lived in Filicudi for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 85-year-old retired postman lives alone at La Canna, which is now closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Each day I look after my little tomatoes and tasty perette, a minuscule variety of pears that grow only here,\" says Anastasi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the sea is calm I walk down to the beach and fish my daily catch, little yummy fishes that I fry for lunch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m happy. This is my world. I always have little things to do and my days are full; I like being alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnastasi\\'s family tell him to avoid watching the news, and he enjoys having the freedom to move around his large garden of fig trees and prickly pears without having to wear a \"mask muzzle,\" although he puts on a face covering to attend Mass.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlicudi\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no roads and zero crowds in Alicudi, one of the smallest of Italy\\'s Aeolian Islands. Silvia Marchetti\\r\\n\\r\\nAlicudi, Filicudi\\'s sister isle, is the most secluded of the Aeolian isles, imbued with a primitive vibe. In this tiny island, Covid is perceived as a very, very distant threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer, Taranto runs a hotel and restaurant named Ericusa on the island. But like most local establishments, it\\'s currently shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilence rules in Alicudi. Forget cars, scooters and even bikes. There are no roads, only dusty mule paths that unwind for 25 kilometers. More than 10,000 stone steps connect the dwellings of this picturesque hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonkeys are the sole means of transport on the island. Alicudi has no ATMs, boutiques, clubs or cigarette vendors. There\\'s no street lighting, just the stars as natural flashlights at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island\\'s pebble beach is dotted with natural arches and bizarre colorful houses that are built inside mushroom-shaped rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlicudi\\'s older residents enjoy spinning spooky tales of flying witches and ghost donkeys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAldo Di Nora, who moved to Alicudi years ago from northern Italy and now runs Casa Ibiscus resort, is very aware of how fortunate he is to live in such a secluded and protected place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Social distancing is not an issue. The only moment when little crowds can form is when people meet at Alicudi\\'s harbor to jump on the ferry boats,\" Di Nora says.',\n",
       " '(CNN) â\\x80\\x94 Stanley Tucci wants to put you straight about Italy. A land where the sun shines, the nonnas smile and every plate of spaghetti bolognese comes showered in parmesan cheese? Scratch that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think in America there are a lot of very specific ideas about what is \\'Italian,\\' and one of the reasons I wanted to do [my new] show is to dispel some of those myths about what Italy is,\" he tells CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People imagine it\\'s always sunny and people are playing mandolins and eating pizza and chicken parmigiana -- which isn\\'t even an Italian dish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because my parents were so respectful of their heritage, that cultural identity was really important to me, and still is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his latest project, the actor is playing himself, as he strives to put the record straight about the country he\\'s descended from on both sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content Tucci\\'s guide to making pizza dough at home\\r\\n\\r\\nPremiering tonight, \"Stanley Tucci: Searching For Italy\" explores the food of six of Italy\\'s best loved places: Naples and the Amalfi Coast, Rome, Bologna, Milan, Tuscany and Sicily.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while it all revolves around the food, the Academy Award nominee was keen to get into the history, culture and politics of Italy -- and why all those things are inseparable from what\\'s on your plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from being a land of renaissance towns sandwiched between mountains and the Med, Italy is home to \"incredible diversity\" geographically, he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe talks about the \"profound effect\" its history -- Italy is a young country, finally unifying in 1861 -- has had on the diet. \"Invasions and religion, politics... each region is so distinctly different, not just the topography, but also the food,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, Italy has had a profound effect on him. Born in the United States, he\\'s descended from Italian immigrants on both sides -- both, in fact, from Calabria, the knobby toe of Italy\\'s boot.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Tucci grew up in New York State, partial to hamburgers, hot dogs and Velveeta cheese, he also was eating \"this really amazing diet\" of Italian food at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, aged 12, Italy changed his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nA personal renaissance\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Tucci spent a year in Italy when he was 12 years old. CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1972, Tucci\\'s father, Stan, a high school art teacher, took a year-long sabbatical to study figure-drawing and sculpture in Florence -- and the family came with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from ski trips to Vermont, \"I had never gone anywhere,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d never been on a plane, never been overseas. So it was incredible. It completely opened my mind to the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a year, he went to an Italian school while his dad studied art and his mother, Joan, brushed up on Tuscan cooking. It was an experience, he says, that \"changed everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First of all, that trip helped inform my aesthetic,\" he says. \"Two, it made me appreciate a European lifestyle and sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the time I graduated college, I was aching to go back again, and I felt like I was meant to be there more than I was supposed to be in America. And so, whenever I could, I would go back to Italy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n...And now time for yours\\r\\n\\r\\nTucci says Americans typically misunderstand Italian food until they visit the country. CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that Italy has given him so much, he\\'s hoping to change how Americans view Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They don\\'t get the extreme diversity of it -- that if you\\'re in Sicily you\\'re less than 100 miles from the coast of Africa, and if you\\'re in northern Italy in Alto Adige, people are speaking Swiss, Italian, German -- a combination of Italian-German and Swiss-German,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that there\\'s not a tomato in sight when you go to Lombardy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated content The tragedy behind Italy\\'s famous pasta dish\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d like people to see that incredible diversity, and how it came about -- from geography, from invasions, from the influences of the Arab world, from the Spanish, the Normans, the Austrians. It\\'s an incredible culinary melting pot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly\\'s food is also notoriously regional, as the series explores -- but so are the people, says Tucci.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you ask people in Italy, so you\\'re Italian? They\\'ll say, \\'No, I\\'m Florentine.\\' Or, \\'No, I\\'m Piedmontese.\\' \\'I\\'m Sicilian.\\' The Sicilians really don\\'t consider themselves Italian.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Minori, a town along Italy\\'s Amalfi Coast, Stanley Tucci samples lemons he calls the best in the world. Watch \"Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy\" Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the more you get into the food, the more you realize how different it is, not just from region to region or city to city, but from house to house, or restaurant to restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People consider parmesan the king of cheeses, but people in Tuscany will say, \\'No, no, it\\'s a terrible cheese. The one you want is Tuscan pecorino.\\' I remember having a conversation with a guy in a deli in Pienza [known for its pecorino cheese] who said, \\'We don\\'t even carry parmesan.\\' It\\'s incredible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference with where he grew up is huge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Someone said to me, \\'The thing about Italy is, you can travel 10 miles and get a completely different menu; in America, you drive 300 miles, you\\'re going to get exactly the same thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nComing together under Covid\\r\\n\\r\\nTucci and wife Felicity dig in to a plate of pasta on the Amalfi Coast. CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, he reckons, is one of the few times Italians have felt Italian, rather than regional.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They really came together in a way that certainly America didn\\'t, or England for that matter,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You felt that there was a real strong sense of togetherness, which there hadn\\'t been for a long time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show filmed both before the pandemic and after the first wave, in summer 2020. He says he found the Italians \"tired, beleaguered by the whole thing, but incredible, open and generous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the borders reopen, they\\'ll need tourism \"desperately.\" But he suggests, tempting as it is to go to the usual big city suspects, \"it\\'ll help a huge amount if you spend [your money] in smaller towns and smaller establishments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while Americans might not be expecting the food that awaits them -- in the US, he says, as he explored in his film, \"Big Night\", \"They expect meatballs to come with the spaghetti, they like huge amounts of cheese, lots of sauce\" -- he thinks they\\'re pleasantly surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Almost every single person I talk to who\\'s American, they say, \\'Oh my god, the food in Italy is incredible.\\' Which means they get it. They understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ultimate Italy\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Tucci visits one of Italy\\'s greatest cheese makers to see him work his magic with mozzarella. Watch \"Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy\" Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT.\\r\\n\\r\\nTucci has been getting \"it\" for almost 50 years now, but although he\\'s traveled extensively around the country, one place he hasn\\'t returned to is the land of his ancestors -- he was last in Calabria when he was a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, he\\'s most taken by the central regions -- Tuscany, Umbria and the Marche -- as well as Rome and Piedmont.

She has five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lived through two world wars and the 1918 Spanish flu, although her grandson Eiji said: \"I don\\'t remember her talking much about the past ... She\\'s very forward thinking -- she really enjoys living in the present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she is almost as old as the modern Olympic Games, which began in 1896\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Olympics were last held in Tokyo in 1964, Tanaka was 61 years old. When counting both the summer and winter editions of the games, this year\\'s Olympics will be the 49th of her lifetime\\r\\n\\r\\nTanaka now lives in a nursing home, where she usually wakes at 6 a.m. and enjoys playing the strategic board game, Othello.

In 2019 , the Guinness Book of World Records certified Tanaka as the world\\'s oldest living person, and now she has her sights on another milestone -- the record for the oldest person to ever live is held by a French woman, who died age 122.\"(Kane) said she wants to break that record,\" said Eiji Tanaka, her grandson.\\r\\n\\r\\nConnecting generations\\r\\n\\r\\nTanaka\\'s family said she hasn\\'t been doing any training for the torch relay, but is excited to be a part of the Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has always loved festivals,\" Eiji Tanaka said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he warned her participation in May -- which is sponsored by a Japanese life insurance company -- will depend on her health and weather conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic-delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Torch Relay starts in Fukushima prefecture on March 25, with several Covid-19 countermeasures in place, officials announced last month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe torch will first go through regions affected by the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, marking the disaster\\'s 10th anniversary, before traveling \"around every corner of Japan,\" officials said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coronavirus restrictions include avoiding \"the 3 Cs\" -- closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who wish to view the relay from the roadside must wear masks, stay home if they feel unwell, and refrain from traveling outside the prefecture they live in.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUST WATCHED Tokyo 2020 torch relay to begin March 25 with infection measures in place Replay More Videos ...

       " \"London (CNN Business) From the English Premier League to the NFL, sport is a multibillion-dollar industry, and top teams are increasingly turning to technology to give them the edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil recently, gathering athletes' performance data was a laborious process. Coaches and sports scientists would spend hours compiling information from games and training sessions, pulling out the information relevant to their players' development. But technology-based performance analytics has changed all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese days, athletes can wear devices or vests with GPS-tracking capabilities that record the speed and distance they run, as well as the impacts on their body. The information helps coaches develop training plans to avoid athlete fatigue and maximize performance for match days.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTATSports, a company based in Northern Ireland, is a leader in the performance analytics industry.

The Argentine made public his desire to leave Barcelona last summer and it looks increasingly unlikely he will sign a new contract, meaning the greatest player in the club\\'s history can walk away for free at the end of the current season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many, many, many millions of debt for Barcelona, the worst financial situation in history,\" Catalunya Radio journalist Ernest MaciÃ\\xa0 tells CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the pitch, we can discuss it, but it seems evident that when the Champions League arrives, Barcelona again commits a public suicide in front of millions of people, receiving so many goals and making it so difficult even for players like Messi who love the club and probably would like to stay at Barcelona in different circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At this point it\\'s not easy to see Messi here next year, although there are many, many different variables intervening in this equation.

There have been debates and anything can happen because a lot of people have voted via mail and it remains to be seen what influence these votes, for the first time in history, will have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJoan Laporta (R) hired Pep Guardiola to be Barcelona new head coach in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other candidates are Victor Font and Toni Freixa, who may \"split the votes,\" Macia says, something that would ultimately benefit Laporta.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucially, Font has received the backing of former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol and has predicated some of his presidential campaign on the idea of club legend Xavi returning to become the new head coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreixa, conversely, has given his backing to current head coach Ronald Koeman to continue the job he was given only last summer, but has also outlined a long-term plan that would see Xavi initially take over the Barcelona B team.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe election will be decided by votes from more than 111,000 club members -- or \\'socis\\' in Catalan -- most of who are fans of Barcelona.

This is as scary as anything!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was roughly halfway through a daring solo adventure -- rowing across the Atlantic -- when she realized that she was teetering on the brink of total calamity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer tiny 550-pound (249 kilograms) rowing boat was on a collision course with a drilling ship, which could easily have swatted her asunder without ever knowing that she was there.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecalling the incident to CNN Sport, the 21-year-old revealed the stream of consciousness that overcame her in that terrifying moment: \"I\\'ve got to use my radio, I\\'ve got to use equipment, maybe flares. Then row, steer! Go do this, go do that. Contact technology. Find out which direction. Bearings! All sorts,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really needed to engage my brain when I\\'ve just been woken at half past four in the morning after a long shift of night rowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that was quite scary,\" she adds, with something of an understatement.\\r\\n\\r\\nJasmine Harrison, a 21-year-old from North Yorkshire, set a new world record for the youngest female solo rower to row any ocean after completing the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirst for adventure\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison is a rare breed of solo adventurers, an ocean rower who\\'d never even picked up an oar until she decided to go for it at the end of 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the first attempt to row across the Atlantic in 1896, only around 900 attempts have been made to row any ocean -- fewer than the number of people who tried to climb Mount Everest in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale solo rowers are even rarer. Fewer than 200 have successfully navigated an ocean and just 18 have made it across the Atlantic on their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison describes herself as a \"normal child,\" but one with a thirst for adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve never really gone on any \\'abroad holidays\\' and I wanted to go to a cool place,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when she turned 18, she packed her bags for the Caribbean and found work as a bartender and a swimming instructor. Working in a bar in Nelson\\'s Dockyard in Antigua, she witnessed the rowers coming ashore in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison says she was hooked, but it took her friends and family a while to realize the enormous scale of her ambition. She admits she also might have understated it to them as \"just a really long race ... might be gone for a few months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s only when I was actually out there, and they see me on TV and they\\'re like: \\'Oh, right! She\\'s serious. This is big!\\'\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Harrison says a lot of research and contemplation went into her decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not a complete, like, free spirit,\" she reflects. \"They wouldn\\'t let us go if they didn\\'t have full trust that we were going to make it to the other side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, she was well aware of the dangers and Harrison wasn\\'t afraid to leverage the risk. \"I could maybe die\" is how she put it as she pursued financial support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said: \\'Well if I don\\'t make it, it\\'s actually a bigger story for you. So please sponsor me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she recounts her escapades from more than two months across 3,000 miles on the high seas, it\\'s clear that adrenaline was a major draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the drilling ship changed course, ghosting past her and off into the night, Harrison\\'s first thought was that she wished her hands would stop shaking so she she could do something.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it wasn\\'t long before she was calculating the narrative currency of her brush with oblivion, exaggerating the drama of a phone call afterward and boasting: \"Guess what? I nearly got hit by a massive ship!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison says that particular incident was the most frightening, because she had some control over it. Equally perilous, though, was the spontaneous drama that nature threw her way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison rowed 3,000 miles across the Atlantic in 70 days, three hours and 48 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice she was pitched into the ocean when rogue waves capsized her boat and even though her little vessel was designed to self-right -- \"he\\'s very clever, he does it himself,\" says Harrison -- she was still injured in the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first occasion, she was violently yanked back out of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was holding onto the grab lines, thinking it wasn\\'t going to self-right,\" she recalls. \"And then he did. Literally flung me out and I just landed on [the] deck. I was like \\'Oh, there we go!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second capsizing was less dramatic because she was safely in her cabin at the time, but her elbow was injured and still bruised upon the completion of her journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nRough going\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal was to try and row 20,000 strokes a day, the equivalent of 60 miles. But when the going was rough, the distance covered might only be a fraction of that -- a spirit-crushing two miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in such moments when Harrison took solace in the wildlife that seemed to be along for the ride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s ridiculous, it\\'s just so cool,\" she enthuses from the quayside in Antigua. \"You\\'re literally less than a foot away from the sea all the time. I saw lots of dolphins; I took a picture and in one snap I had 40 dolphins in one picture. It\\'s insane!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw whales, marlin, I even had a little crab on my boat.\" adds Harrison, whose Facebook feed shows her holding a flying fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon watching her videos back of these magical encounters, her joy is infectious as she narrates the scene to nobody in particular, struggling to find the appropriate words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the most exciting thing ever in my life. Oh my God, that was like -- aargh! Oh my gosh, f***ing hell!\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked if she thought the fish were aware of her presence, she\\'s in no doubt that they were.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are 100 percent aware. Every morning I\\'ll, sort of, put my hand in the water and the pilot fish would swim to my hand and I\\'m like \\'Morning! Where are you going to take me today? Backwards again!\\'\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison says she spent many long hours deep in her own thoughts, realizing that very few people on Earth could ever experience such extreme solitude for so long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many times is a human being so far away from another human being?\" she ponders. \"Even if you\\'re at home alone in the house by yourself, you\\'ve got a neighbor -- literally -- sat a few meters away on the other side of the wall. I just feel so lucky, it\\'s like -- wow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison raised over $15,000 for the Shelterbox & Blue Marine Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecord breaker\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 70 days, three hours and 48 minutes, Harrison made it to Antigua and pulled her final strokes into the Guinness Book of World Records.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt just 21, she\\'s the youngest female to have rowed solo across any ocean; she\\'s a trailblazer, a pioneer, somebody that will inspire women and girls all over the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving taken her first, tentative, steps back on dry land, she was faced with more than a dozen interviews. Out of everything she has experienced since departing the Canary Islands in December, the media interest has been the most surprising -- she says she just doesn\\'t understand what all the fuss is about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was just doing this because it\\'s something I wanted to do. I only wanted to cross an ocean. I didn\\'t really think that the rest of the world were going to want to know what I\\'m doing. I mean, this is just my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen pushed for a reason to try and explain all of the interest, Harrison concedes: \"Because it\\'s cool. Especially at the moment, during lockdown, something has happened. The Talisker Whiskey Challenge happened when everything else was canceled. And that\\'s just insane.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe doesn\\'t yet have any plans for another adventure, but already she has concluded that trying to top this experience would only \"ruin\" it. In time, the magnitude of her accomplishment will sink in\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will also take time for the bruises to heal and for the ground to steady beneath her feet; the waking memories of her voyage are still so visceral.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison barely slept in her first night back on dry land, the wide-open space of her stable bed was too much of an adjustment, never mind that she \"wasn\\'t suffocating on my own breath in the tiny cabin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I started rocking backwards and forwards really fast and I was like -- OK, balance, balance, I\\'m not in the boat,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a weird feeling, but absolutely wonderful. To feel that you\\'re still in another place, in another world. And you\\'re not? That\\'s so cool!\"',\n",
       " '(CNN) Ten years ago following Darren Clarke\\'s win at a wild and wet 2011 Open tournament, one of the world\\'s top golf courses embarked on a modernizing mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn\\'t a tale, however, about technological upgrades and a futuristic vision, instead Royal St George\\'s in Kent set out on a journey back to how it looked a century ago: a duneland paradise for flora and fauna.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith assistant greenkeeper Paul Larsen promoted to head in 2012, work with Natural England began in earnest in 2013 to improve the course\\'s \\'unfavorable\\' Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nEasier said than done considering Larsen and his troops look after a 500-acre nationally protected estate of which the course itself comprises roughly 10%.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after consultation with Natural England\\'s Phil Williams and Dr. Graham Earl, invading species of grasses more commonly found on inland, parkland golf courses were burnt down and thinner, wispier fescue grasses have returned alongside wild orchids in their abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think people are going to be surprised in a good way when they see it this time compared to 2011,\" Larsen told CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rank, thick grass was rubbish for golf, because you\\'d lose your ball and take 10 hours to get around, but also for wildlife. Birds like skylarks nest in the grass, and when you start making rank vegetation they can\\'t do that. What people forget is we\\'re a dunelands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA picture of the controlled burning taking place at Royal St. George\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoyal St George\\'s succeeded in its quest to achieve \\'favorable\\' status largely thanks to Larsen\\'s drive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The mentality \\'it\\'s more work\\' was not how he saw it and the course has flourished,\" Williams told CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Paul often says he used to see it as a golf club with a sand dune on it, and now he sees it as a sand dune system with a golf course on it. Changing perceptions is what we need.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sandwich Bay SSSI -- which incorporates former Open host courses Prince\\'s and Royal Cinque Ports -- is home to 90% of the UK\\'s lizard orchid population, one of Britain\\'s rarest plants, while otters and once extinct beavers have \"surreptitiously returned\" said Williams.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiving land back\\r\\n\\r\\nLarsen himself is delighted by the about turn -- from improvements in his own trade, to the working relationship with Natural England and to the flora and fauna explosion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some trees had started to come down, and we found a little family of beavers that had claimed the land for themselves. A night vision camera was put in an old tree and we saw three beavering about, like they do,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m a greenkeeper and I\\'ve learned so much about flowers and nature -- I\\'ve changed.

Natural England are pleased about that because I\\'ve given land back to them. The birds can go in there and I\\'m not wasting time cutting short grass,\" said Larsen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We weren\\'t always in sync with Natural England. If we wanted to build a new tee, they wouldn\\'t let us. But we worked together to get to where we are today.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t all easy however -- Larsen said he risked the wrath of the old secretary when advised by Williams and Earl to burn back the invading grasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'d say: \\'What the hell have you done now?!\\' I\\'ve taken a lot of flak to get to where I\\'ve got to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Nairn Dunbar in Scotland -- co-host of this June\\'s Amateur Championship -- course manager Richard Johnstone told CNN a lightbulb went off in his head about a sustainable future as soon as he was promoted in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Part of my interview was a proposal for the restoration of the links environment -- the course had been over-watered and over-fertilized and was becoming more parkland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rough was so dense we were getting lots of negative feedback about lost balls and slow play.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aerial view of the par 4, eighth hole looking back to the tee from the green as the sun rises at The Royal St. George\\'s Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemicals and clippings\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnstone also faced some opposition to change but after Nairn was crowned 2021 Environmental Golf Course of the Year it was a nice reward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the industry a lot of people think it\\'s all about wildlife and \\'making bird feeders\\'. \\'But these awards are not about that. It goes right through the whole management process, going chemical free and so on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnstone said Nairn moved to a largely chemical-free program in 2016, in line with the banning of products to suppress worms and grubs and prevent turf disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nA before, left, and after split of the effect of moving to a largely chemical-free program at Nairn.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourses in Europe have, in places, gone even further than the UK -- something Larsen saw first-hand when he worked in the Netherlands from 2007-2011 -- but Johnstone said the use of chemicals is an issue that needs addressing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you look in the chemical cabinets of some American courses, they\\'re the size of my whole facility. Probably 50 x 20 meters. My cabinet is 1 x 1 meter, two bottles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLarsen said his use of 30-50kgs of nitrogen a year is nothing compared to a football ground, who might put that amount on their penalty spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Links courses can set the way and say: \\'This is how it is in a sustainable way, fewer fertilizers and fungicides.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can do our bit over here and show that golf courses don\\'t have to be perfect. After all, is perfection what you want at the expense of nature?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while phasing out chemicals might take longer, Williams said greenkeepers worldwide could immediately make one very simple change.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they cut the greens from the tees and the fairways a problem you often see is the clippings are piled up out the way behind the green, which creates a massive area of nutrient enrichment. They could be dumped on a very important piece of vegetation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take it away, compost it down and use it as a fertilizer on the greens, tees and fairways.

       " '(CNN) When your career highs come around only once every four years, the prospect of putting your aspirations on hold can be difficult to stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a reality that all athletes hopeful of competing at the Olympics were faced with last year when, for the first time ever, the Games were postponed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was hard to absorb, and it still is. It\\'s felt like we\\'ve been sitting in a purgatory for a whole year now,\" says Sandi Morris, a US pole vault silver medalist from the 2016 Rio Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 12 months on from the postponement of Tokyo 2020, a new goal is now in sight. With restrictions and safety measures still being put in place, the Olympics are set to begin on July 23 this year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m starting to feel a sense of normalcy, and I\\'m actually training for something instead of just training and training with no competition or destination in sight,\" adds Morris, speaking on CNN\\'s Coronavirus: Fact vs Fiction podcast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s definitely different now that we have hope; last March felt pretty hopeless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA year can be a significant period of time in an athlete\\'s career.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Morris, it offered a chance to recover from niggling shin injuries and to sharpen her technique. But for her husband Tyrone Smith, a three-time Olympic long jumper close to calling time on his athletic career, the postponement led to a period of introspection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I probably experienced some mild depression once that announcement came because I had been building everything towards this last hurrah, making those sacrifices in a time in my life where the sacrifices were harder,\" says Smith, who is also an MBA student at the University of Texas at Austin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was disheartening, gutting, all those words, and it took some soul-searching for me to decide: am I able to continue to do this for another year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTyrone Smith carries the flag for Bermuda during the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreative problem solving\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, Smith, who competes for Bermuda but lives in the United States, decided to train for another year.

I asked myself: where is it going to start? By the foot? By the hands? By the head? Is it going to be painful or not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrosjean\\'s car caught fire after colliding with the barrier on the first lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he thought of his family, thousands of miles away back home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was in peace and accepting it, but then that\\'s where I thought about my kids and that I couldn\\'t leave three kids without a dad,\" says Grosjean of sons Sacha and Simon and daughter Camille.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had to try a last attempt. That moment was more like a reset button for my brain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race in Bahrain proved to be Grosjean\\'s last in Formula One.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hands blistered from burns suffered during the crash, the 34-year-old says he still has work to do to regain full mobility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s two, two-and-a-half months now and two-and-a-half months that I am in pain,\" says Grosjean. \"I could use painkillers, but psychologically I stopped painkillers, so I don\\'t want to get back at it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill battling the physical repercussions of the crash, Grosjean has also had time to consider its emotional consequences as he prepares to get back behind the wheel and race again.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrosjean and his wife Marion walk in the paddock ahead of the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an F1 career that saw 10 podiums in 179 race starts, he has signed up to compete in IndyCar in the United States with Dale Coyne Racing. His first testing session takes place on Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Driving on my own won\\'t be a problem at all,\" says Grosjean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think the question that I have and can\\'t answer right now is how is it going to be in the peloton with other drivers, the race starts, and so on; is it going to bring back memories? Is it going to frighten me? But I\\'m optimistic that it\\'s going to be alright.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndyCar races are contested across different types of track -- ovals, street circuits and road courses.

I didn\\'t like it,\" adds Grosjean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t think it was great for motorsport. I must say I changed my mind big time and that I won\\'t race a car with no halo because it\\'s saving our lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jules saved my life with the introduction of the halo. We\\'re going to learn from Anthoine and from myself and just make sure that we get better and better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s never going to be safe. Motorsport is dangerous, we know that.

It is climbing, but it\\'s a combination of just about everything I experienced before, just combined in one thing,\" Å\\xa0kofic told CNN Sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth climbers are world-class in their own right.\\r\\n\\r\\nÅ\\xa0kofic, 26, was a climbing prodigy and won the Lead Climbing World Cup title in 2016; Garnbret is quite simply one of the most talented sport climbers on the planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 21-year-old has won multiple world championships and World Cup titles and is one of the favorites to win gold when climbing eventually makes its debut at the Tokyo Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite their expertize, the challenge was still way out of their comfort zone, with both more accustomed to indoor climbing where the wall is usually no more than 30 meters high.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis route, however, contained 13 pitches (or sections) and involved rope techniques that are very different from what they are normally used to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chimney itself was built in 1976 and used to emit emissions out of the valley where it\\'s situated. It\\'s been nonoperational since 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanja Garnbret and Domen Å\\xa0kofic celebrate their ascent on top of the Trbovlje Chimney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Not in my comfort zone\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the new route, specifically designed over the course of five years, provided a real endurance test for the two climbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It definitely helps you grow as a person,\" Garnbret told CNN Sport. \"You get a new perspective on climbing and you just get a different feeling, like something I\\'ve never done before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It really helps because I\\'m a person who is always looking for a challenge, who always wants to do something new, to do something better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So this is definitely a cool project and it was not in my comfort zone. I had to step out and just enjoy the whole process.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first attempt took nearly 12 hours and both climbers fell on a number of pitches. Carrying heavy backpacks left them physically exhausted and they realized they hadn\\'t brought sufficient food and drinks to sustain them.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndeterred, the pair regrouped and went again four days later, successfully scaling the chimney in seven hours and 32 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nReaching the top after such a grueling climb is a feeling that neither will forget in a hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I think back now, I remember how uncomfortable it felt, how it was hot, it was cold, it was windy, it was everything,\" Garnbret added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I also said one time that I never want to go again, that this was my last try and I never want to go again. But it was a super amazing experience and yeah, I was really happy when I came on the top.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe route took five years to plan and build.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'I was more scared looking up\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough heights come with the territory for climbers, neither had ever experienced such a vertical before.\\r\\n\\r\\nÅ\\xa0kofic still remembers the stomach-churning feeling of standing at the foot of the chimney, looking up as the top disappeared into the clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was more scared looking up, watching the chimney. I mean, I had huge respect,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But when I was on the wall, I kind of fell into the climbing so much that I basically forgot about the heights.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to being an exhausting physical challenge, both agreed that it tested their mental capacity just as much.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir very safety was dependent on maintaining focus for hours on end and every mistake counts when you\\'re dangling on a climb like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarnbret, who was also comfortable with the dizzying heights, initially struggled with the technique of falling off such a surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndoor walls tend to have a slight overhang which prevents climbers from smashing into the wall when they fall off but the chimney didn\\'t provide such luxury.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The chimney had the same angle for three hundred and sixty meters. It was almost vertical,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So when you fell, you fell hard into the wall. So it\\'s something different [...] I had to get used to the falling to just keep this out of my mind. Like to not be scared to fall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter reflecting on the achievement, neither has ruled out tackling a similar challenge in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil then, both are excited about the possibility of climbing competitions returning after the pandemic and Garnbret has her eyes firmly focused on the Olympics.',\n",

It was just this really quiet special moment in this magical place. And it\\'s something I\\'ll never forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEmily Harrington became the first woman to free climb the Golden Gate route of El Capitan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Mental struggle\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nFree climbers use just their hands and feet to climb, with a rope to catch them if they fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a high-stakes, and potentially life-threatening, challenge requires years of preparation, both mentally and physically.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrington had climbed this particular route over the course of six days in 2015 and had subsequently tried three times to complete it within 24 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, an attempt last year ended in disaster after Harrington fell 50 feet, hit her head on a ledge, and suffered concussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very scary. It was very serious initially and it turned out that I got really lucky and I did not suffer any long-term injuries,\" she added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s definitely a mental struggle, coming over that hurdle, coming back into this year and trying again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since she started climbing as a 10-year-old, El Capitan has enchanted Harrington. She\\'s spent numerous hours practicing different pitches (various sections of a climbing wall) to become accustom to arguably the most famous rock in the world of climbing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, El Capitan has captured the public\\'s imagination after Alex Honnold climbed it without a safety rope in the Oscar-winning documentary Free Solo, which was released in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonnold was one of two people to help Harrington on her successful ascent, the other being her fiancee Adrian Ballinger -- an experienced climber and mountaineer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth climbers took turns assisting Harrington, with Honnold helping for the first two thirds of the climb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair essentially \"caterpillared\" the wall, with Harrington attached to the top of the rope and Honnold to the bottom. The technique helps speed up the ascent, but is risky.\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger then took over belaying duties on the harder, steeper sections near the top where Harrington knew she would have to slow down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe couple then took it pitch by pitch, with Harrington waiting for her partner to catch up before taking on another section.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s been the one who supported me while I practiced on the wall,\" said Harrington of Ballinger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s my partner in life as well and I just knew that it was going to get harder and I knew that it was going to get emotionally difficult.

Everything was going to be fine,\" she said, admitting her mind might have been focused on the upcoming pitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The next thing I know, I just saw black and I felt the wetness of blood pouring down my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I realized that I had hit my head again and that was definitely a rock bottom moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gash on her head was deep and it seemed as though the challenge would have to be abandoned yet again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, this time, she hadn\\'t suffered concussion. A makeshift plaster stemmed the bloodflow and, determined not to let another fall steal her dream, Harrington gave the pitch one more go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I just had one of those crazy, out of body, flow state experiences, where you don\\'t really even think and you\\'re just sort of climbing and almost watching myself climb from a distance,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a pretty magical feeling, actually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To have that really dramatic thing happen and get injured and have all that deja vu from the previous year and then be able to turn it around and climb perfectly and then continue to the top.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climber suffered a deep cut to her head after a dramatic fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nUS election\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrington is able to laugh that the fall helped write the \"perfect script\" to her climb, which was inspired by pioneering rock climber Lynn Hill, the first person to free climb El Capitan in under 24 hours, back in 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climb also served as the perfect distraction from what was arguably one of the most important days in US history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Harrington scrambled up the rock face, millions of Americans waited to see who their new president would be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrington says she had always planned to be ready in early November and admits attempting the feat on election night was semi deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everyone in this country was feeling a lot of uncertainty and a lot of lack of control,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had no control over what was going to happen and everyone was just sitting there doom-scrolling on their phones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, in a way, I was like, \\'This will be a good distraction, it\\'ll be a good way to not focus on that and not drive myself crazy.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It worked out, I definitely thought about it a lot less than most people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrington stops the clock having reached the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere it all began\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an only child, Harrington\\'s competitive edge began with a healthy rivalry with her cousins.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remembers the first time she competed against them on a small, local climbing wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The instant I stepped on the wall, there was this feeling of \\'Oh, this is what I want to do,\\'\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I belonged there in a way and I just remember telling my dad that I wanted to climb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe initially excelled at indoor competitions, becoming the US sport climbing champion five times and twice winning the North American championship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transition into the world of outdoor climbing only began after signing with the North Face\\'s athletic program, and her climbing future was sealed when she met her partner while climbing Mount Everest in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe subsequently moved to California and began climbing in Yosemite National Park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People talk about conquering your fears, they talk about beating your fears, making your fears go away, I don\\'t ever really feel that. I feel fear quite frequently, honestly,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I work through it by just accepting it and trying to understand why it\\'s there and then taking steps to move forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 34-year-old says she reguarly feels fear when climbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We should be less afraid to be afraid.

At the age of 16, Priscilla Frederick-Loomis attended a model agency casting session in New York City where she was told that she was \"too heavy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven now at the age of 31, those two words still play on the Olympic high jumper\\'s mind. Raised by a single mother in New Jersey, Loomis also toyed with the idea of becoming an actor and that\\'s a dream she hasn\\'t given up on as she has pursued her athletics career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to use track and field as a way to make a name for myself,\" Loomis, who is a two-time Pan American Games silver medalist and competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, tells CNN Sport from her home in the US.

I didn\\'t even realize a lot of female athletes have eating disorders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at that point in her career, that\\'s what Loomis felt she had to do to be successful given she was 158 lbs and is 5 ft 10 tall, which she noted is six inches shorter and at least 20 pounds more than her rivals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my head, it was common sense: don\\'t eat a lot, look better, jump better,\" said Loomis, who remembers a time at college when her then coach Richard Fisher advised her to grab something to eat after a training session.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted an ice cream, a little ice cream,\" she says as she demonstrated how small the size was.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept another coach told Loomis to put the ice cream down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my head, that stuck with me for so long because I was like, \\'I\\'m making bad decisions.

Over Brooks\\' 30 year career, she has treated many patients who suffer from eating disorders and acted as the eating disorders specialist in the HBO film Thin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a US study -- Prevalence of Eating disorders among Blacks in the National Survey of American Life -- anorexia was the rarest eating disorder among African American adults and adolescents, while binge eating was the most prevalent eating disorder among adults and adolescents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are really understanding more and more that eating disorders are not just a White, suburban women\\'s disease, and that, you know, for a long time the belief was that women of color, particularly Black women, were protected culturally from developing eating disorders,\" said Dr. Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she trained for her first Olympic appearance in 2016, Loomis adhered to a strict diet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would eat super healthy and super clean, be on it for a month.

More specifically, what it means to be feminine and masculine and how female athletes\\' bodies may defy this stereotype and in turn be ridiculed for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe points out that there have been small shifts in society, such as the body positivity movement, which was originally founded by black women, who celebrated their body types and reclaimed traditionally negative terms such as \"fat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Dr. Matheson also argues that the body positivity movement has been \"whitewashed, with many campaigns dismissing the origins of the movement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGB\\'s women\\'s 4x400m relay team celebrate receiving their reallocated bronze medals, from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games during Day One of the Muller Anniversary Games at the London Stadium on July 21, 2018 in London, England.\\r\\n\\r\\nReal models\\r\\n\\r\\nOkoro is hoping to round off her 20-year career with a gold medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics -- but just as importantly fight body image expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got one body, and it was doing pretty great for me, so I needed to look after it,\" said Okoro, who has drawn inspiration from Serena Williams.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Brundish references, Williams has been a key point in the conversation surrounding body image. The 23-time grand-slam champion was criticized for her shape and size. Two years ago, Williams published a letter online addressed to her mother sharing the struggles she\\'s faced with people\\'s body image expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote : \"It has been said I don\\'t belong in women\\'s sports -- that I belong in men\\'s -- because I look stronger than many other women do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I just work hard, and I was born with this badass body and proud of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams says her daughter Olympia shares the same physique and, in the letter, she expresses, \"I don\\'t know how I would react if she [her daughter] has to go through what I\\'ve gone through since I was a 15-year-old and even to this day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We don\\'t all look the same. We are curvy, strong, muscular, tall, small, just to name a few, and all the same: we are women and proud!\" Williams said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkoro has also drawn inspiration from women athletes in rugby and football.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'re not your stereotypical beauty queens but they are caring less about how they look and getting dirty and delivering some great performances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOkoro wants a new era of role models, or as she calls them \"real models.\"',\n",

The city is also the first in the UK to be hit by the heroin epidemic that will go on to wreck a generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLiverpool was being forced on its knees,â\\x80\\x9d lifelong Liverpool supporter and retired academic Gordon Jenkins, 61, tells CNN. â\\x80\\x9cI remember Chelsea fans used to wave Â£20 notes at us and say, â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ve got loads of money.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a red-hot July day in 1981, thousands of well-wishers lined London\\'s streets to cheerily wave Union flags in celebration of Charles and Diana\\'s wedding in the English capital. Two-hundred miles away, Liverpool was burning. Appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, had exploded into anger, rapidly descending into nine days of disorder which resulted in hundreds of injuries, arrests and one death.\\r\\n\\r\\nWidely referred to as the Toxteth Riots, locally it is known as the â\\x80\\x98uprising.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis was a city without leadership,â\\x80\\x9d wrote Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister who would go on to construct a framework to revive Liverpool, in his autobiography.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.â\\x80\\x9d Geoffrey Howe, UK finance minister, 1979-83\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the unrest, Thatcherâ\\x80\\x99s closest ministers talked of a â\\x80\\x9cmanaged declineâ\\x80\\x9d of the city, National Archives files would reveal in 2011, with Thatcher\\'s finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, warning: \"We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during this decade Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of Britain. Thatcher had polarized and radicalized. A broken working-class city which, historically, had not always leaned to the political left turned red.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut during these divisive times the people had football, two of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s outstanding teams in Liverpool and Everton. The beautiful game gave Liverpudlians heroes and hope. Football, says Jenkins, was, and still is, â\\x80\\x9cinexorably woven into the fabric of why we are who we are.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1981 to 1990, the two Merseyside clubs between them won nine league titles, two European Cups, a Cup Winners\\' Cup, three FA Cups and three League Cups.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiverpool Football Club had become the bastion of invincibility former manager Bill Shankly had envisaged when rebuilding the club in the 1960s. Shanklyâ\\x80\\x99s successors, all appointed from within, had carried the torch. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. Seamless successions upon which a dynasty was built.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe succession: Following in the footsteps of managerial greats\\r\\n\\r\\nBILL\\r\\n\\r\\nSHANKLY 783 GAMES / 1959-74 Lost 22.7% Drawn 25.3% Won 51.9% BOB\\r\\n\\r\\nPAISLEY 535 GAMES / 1974-83 L 17.9% D 24.5% W 57.6% JOE\\r\\n\\r\\nFAGAN 131 GAMES / 1983-85 L 18.3% D 27.5% W 54.2% KENNY\\r\\n\\r\\nDALGLISH 307 GAMES / 1985-91 & 2011-12 L 13.7% D 25.4% W 60.9% JURGEN\\r\\n\\r\\nKLOPP 256 GAMES / 2015-PRESENT L 16.8% D 22.7% W 60.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was there eight years, the worst we ever finished in the league was second,â\\x80\\x9d Gillespie, who left Liverpool for Celtic in 1991, says. â\\x80\\x9cIf you finished second it was deemed a failure, youâ\\x80\\x99d had a poor season regardless of what else youâ\\x80\\x99d won.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league title was, says Gillespie, the \"be all and end allâ\\x80\\x9d and this was especially the case in the latter half of the decade when English clubs were indefinitely banned from European competition following the Heysel disaster in 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe never got allowed to get carried away,â\\x80\\x9d Gillespie says, identifying the camaraderie formed on boozy nights out as one of the reasons for the clubâ\\x80\\x99s success.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe coaching staff were always calling us â\\x80\\x98big headsâ\\x80\\x99 and any opportunity they had they would try to knock you down. There was never too much praise for us. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think we needed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen we came in after games, we would have to tie our boots so it was easier for the coaching staff to put the boots away. When we took our kit off, we just didnâ\\x80\\x99t throw it on the floor; we had to put the shorts in a pile and the tops in a pile. It was little things like that that kept you grounded.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA city grieving\\r\\n\\r\\nThough football saved the city during this decade, it was also the source of unimaginable pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 15, 1989, Liverpool fans were crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace in Hillsborough, Sheffield, during an FA Cup semifinal. Ninety-six men, women and children unlawfully killed, an inquest would find 28 years later, due to police failings and the criminal gross negligence of the officer in command.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers had watched the injured and dying being carried away on advertising hoardings used as emergency stretchers and, in the weeks that followed, provided solace for the grieving. At one stage, the 38-year-old Dalglish, by now Liverpoolâ\\x80\\x99s player-manager, attended four funerals a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding to the suffering were the false accusations, published on the front page of the Rupert Murdoch-owned English newspaper â\\x80\\x98The Sunâ\\x80\\x99 immediately after the disaster, that Liverpool fans had urinated on police and pickpocketed dead victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt [the disaster] left its mark on a lot of people,â\\x80\\x9d says Gillespie, conceding that the players still do not like to talk about the tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of that year, defending league champions Liverpool had been in an unfamiliar position: fifth in the league and nine points behind leaders Arsenal. And, so, the second half of the season was spent in relentless pursuit of the Londoners, with Liverpool eventually bumping Arsenal from the summit with two games remaining thanks to 21 wins in 24 games. Yet the championship was not yet won. The end-of-season title-decider was still to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nArsenalâ\\x80\\x99s April visit to Anfield had been rescheduled to the final day of the season because of the Hillsborough disaster, resulting in the jittery Londoners arriving on Merseyside needing to beat their rivals, who six days earlier had won the FA Cup, by two goals to become champions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one expected Arsenal to win but this Friday night match under the lights was made legendary as soon as the final whistle blew. In a hallucinatory ending, with seconds remaining and the visitors 1-0 ahead, Arsenal\\'s Michael Thomas burst from midfield and scored, securing an extraordinary 2-0 win -- and the championship -- for the Gunners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the final whistle, television cameras capture Dalglish standing silently near the Liverpool dugout, looking into the middle-distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen Arsenal score, you can see a lot of them (Liverpool players) collapse to the floor. They were playing three games a week; theyâ\\x80\\x99d been going to all the funerals, and there was a sense that a lot of them were exhausted,â\\x80\\x9d says Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness as usual\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who witnessed it, the 1988/89 season finale lives strong in the memory. But when Liverpool\\'s players returned to pre-season training four weeks later, no one at the club mentioned the Arsenal defeat, or even the previous campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe coaching staff, the manager, the whole ethos of the club was to never look back, to never linger, regardless of whether you had won the title or lost it. It was just something that was ingrained in us,â\\x80\\x9d Gillespie explains.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo win the championship after a heartbreaking decade ... it was a remarkable achievement.â\\x80\\x9d Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan\\r\\n\\r\\nLiverpoolâ\\x80\\x99s only major signing that summer was Swedish defender Glenn Hysen, bought from Fiorentina for Â£600,000 ($670,472).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 9-0 thumping of Crystal Palace, but this was not a particularly dazzling Liverpool vintage. A 4-1 loss to Southampton led to an indifferent patch and, while Liverpool ended the year topping the table, by March Aston Villa had the initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeet the 1989/90 squad\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Villa stuttered. A home loss to Manchester City was followed by a 3-3 draw with Norwich City and, as any seasoned predator would, Liverpool capitalized. On April 28, 1990, having that day beaten QPR 2-1 at Anfield, Liverpool regained the title.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo win the championship after a heartbreaking decade â\\x80¦ it was a remarkable achievement,â\\x80\\x9d says Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99d been so successful for so long, to say we took it for granted wasnâ\\x80\\x99t quite the case because it was always a great privilege to be a Liverpool supporter, [but] it was like normal service being resumed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRelief for a job well done\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smartphone, let alone a wireless network, was still some years from being part of everyday life, so it was left to Anfieldâ\\x80\\x99s stadium announcer to inform fans that Liverpool had won a sixth championship in 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttending his first Anfield match that day was a seven-year-old John Gibbons. As Liverpool\\'s players walked around the pitch to acknowledge the fans -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the club\\'s idiosyncratic goalkeeper, performing handstands -- Gibbons remembers standing on a seat and serenading the champions to \\'You\\'ll Never Walk Alone.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was all fairly understated,â\\x80\\x9d Gibbons, a contributor to the Anfield Wrap podcast, tells CNN. â\\x80\\x9cIt was exciting, it was good, but if youâ\\x80\\x99d told anyone in that ground that it would be 30 years until theyâ\\x80\\x99d win the next one, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have believed you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the players, soaking up the pressures of expectation was over until the next season at least. â\\x80\\x9cYou put 10 months on hold, you give your all for 10 months,â\\x80\\x9d says Gillespie. â\\x80\\x9cFortunately for us we were normally successful, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you can enjoy it [a season].â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish football goes global\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at the beginning of the hedonistic 1990s, Liverpool would learn that even great clubs cannot pause to catch a breath. As Shankly once said: \"Football is relentless ... it goes on and on like a river.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of February 22, 1991, with three months remaining of the 1990/91 season, photographers, TV crews and journalists had assembled at Anfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cityâ\\x80\\x99s newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, had already prepared its front page because it knew what was to come: Dalglish, with Liverpool three points clear at the top of the table, was going to resign as Liverpool manager.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKenny Dalglish as a person has pushed himself to the limit,â\\x80\\x9d said the Scot during the news conference, flashbulbs lighting up his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a Liverpool player, Dalglish had won three European Cups, five league titles and four League Cups and added three more league titles and two FA Cups, including a league and cup double, as player-manager.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was a man who had taken on the cityâ\\x80\\x99s grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a recent documentary about the man regarded as Liverpoolâ\\x80\\x99s greatest player, his family talked of the impact Hillsborough had on him: sleepless nights, mood swings, a rash covering his body, the struggle to make simple decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had also taken charge of the team shortly after 39 Juventus fans had died before the Italian clubâ\\x80\\x99s European Cup final against Liverpool in the Belgian city of Brussels. Supporters, the youngest just 11 years old, killed in a stampede before kick-off in the dilapidated Heysel stadium. It had all taken its toll.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt all started going wrong when Kenny left,â\\x80\\x9d says Gillespie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cracks, which arguably had first appeared when the team suffered an FA Cup semifinal loss to Crystal Palace in 1990, deepened. Celebrated players came to the end of their careers and new manager Graeme Souness made unsuitable, expensive signings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty miles away great rivals Manchester United were readying to dominate English footballâ\\x80\\x99s new age. The birth of the Premier League in 1992 led to a boom: wealth, glitz and the globalization of the English game. Successful on the pitch, United flourished commercially.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is Anfield: The history of an iconic stadium Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally home to Liverpoolâ\\x80\\x99s city rivals Everton, who moved out in 1891. A year later, newly-formed Liverpool started to play there. The stadium, which has four stands, has become one of footballâ\\x80\\x99s most iconic venues. In 1906, the famous Spion Kop was constructed. It was converted into an all-seater stand in 1994. Around the stadium there are nods to the clubâ\\x80\\x99s past, such as The Shankly Gates, The Paisley Gateway and The Hillsborough Memorial. The Main Stand, built in the 19th century, has been redeveloped in the last decade, boosting Anfieldâ\\x80\\x99s capacity to 54,074.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with English newspaper The Guardian in 2002, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who would guide the Old Trafford club to 13 league titles, uttered a now famous sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis greatest challenge, he said, was â\\x80\\x9cknocking Liverpool right off their f***ing perch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith 20 league titles to Liverpoolâ\\x80\\x99s 18, the Manchester club can still crow, but United are not the dominant force they once were.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack on their perch?\\r\\n\\r\\nSome fans have been known to request selfies on the Kop with Chris Bolland, once they learn how long the 63-year-old has been attending matches at Anfield. A familiar face in the stands since 1966, he remembers plenty of title wins. But neither of his two sons have experienced the joy of watching the team lift a championship trophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family has experienced close calls over the last three decades â\\x80\\x93 second-place finishes under Rafael Benitez and Brendan Rodgers, and last season\\'s astonishing 97-point haul which was eclipsed only by Manchester City -- but during those seasons Liverpool weren\\'t unquestionably the best. Fans dreamed, but never fully believed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis season, however, Kloppâ\\x80\\x99s men have dropped just five points. Never has a team negotiated a season in Englandâ\\x80\\x99s top flight in such a relentless, uncompromising manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nPostponed indefinitely because of the pandemic, no one knows with certainty when or how English football will resume. If the Premier League season were unable to be completed, would Liverpool be denied the championship? For now, that is the unanswered question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nervousness which rumbled around Anfield at times last season as the team vied with Manchester City in one of the closest title races in recent memory â\\x80\\x93 though they lost only once, Liverpool missed out on the title by a point â\\x80\\x93 had vanished this season.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinning the European Cup in Madrid last June, Kloppâ\\x80\\x99s first major trophy as Liverpool manager, had strengthened the fans\\' faith in the players. They believed. But anxiety increases in uncertain times.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoy Bratherton, 64, moved to Liverpool in 1974 to be nearer Anfield. Once just one of the few female faces among a crowd of thousands on the Kop, she was enduring sleepless nights even before a global pandemic stopped Liverpool\\'s charge to the league title.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether Liverpool will win the Premier League is, she says, \"the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the nighttime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am having very mixed dreams when I doze off,\" she adds, speaking to CNN days before the UK was put into lockdown. \"The strain and stress of the last two seasons has been overpowering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was after comfortably beating Manchester United in January that the first chants of â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re going to win the leagueâ\\x80\\x9d echoed around Anfield. A new banner also popped up in the stands at the beginning of the year with the sentence, â\\x80\\x9cThis Bird Is Getting Back On Its Perch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the deaths and suffering caused by coronavirus have changed perspectives. Dreams of winning a first league title in 30 years are no longer all-consuming.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll Never Walk Alone is not just a song, itâ\\x80\\x99s not merely an anthem, itâ\\x80\\x99s a statement of intent.â\\x80\\x9d Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not being able to be crowned champions for the foreseeable future is completely irrelevant. It absolutely doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter,\" says Jenkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jurgen Klopp, who is Bill Shankly reincarnated, has said football is the most important of the least important things and that just nails it completely. \\'Youâ\\x80\\x99ll Never Walk Alone\\' is not just a song, itâ\\x80\\x99s not merely an anthem, itâ\\x80\\x99s a statement of intent. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not just about Liverpool people, itâ\\x80\\x99s about people generally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we didnâ\\x80\\x99t win the league because it was voided, that would be unfair but not a disaster. The real wait is for when we can all go to the match again. That wait is more painful than whether we win the league or not.\"',\n",
       " 'Global Investment How billionaire owners changed European football\\r\\n\\r\\n(CNN) â\\x80\\x94 European football is no stranger to billionaire owners, and the latest deep-pocketed investor to show interest in acquiring a team stirred the English Premier League as it lay dormant during the coronavirus lockdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s Public Investment Fund (PIF), chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is part of a three-party consortium attempting to buy Newcastle United. The other partners are PCP Capital Partners, a venture capital and private equity company run by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, and private equity and real estate firm Reuben Brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Newcastle fans, the proposed takeover heralds overdue change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 13 years under the ownership of Mike Ashley, the British businessman who runs retail brand Sports Direct, the feeling is that the club has been starved of investment for too long.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewcastle, a powerful force in English football during the 1990s, suffered two relegations under Ashleyâ\\x80\\x99s tenure. The decision to temporarily rename the club stadium to The Sports Direct Arena in 2011 was also met with fan resentment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHostility to the Ashley regime probably explains why a survey by the Newcastle United Supporters Trust in April found that 96.7% of the more than 3,397 fans questioned were in favor of the new ownership group, which is being fronted by PCP.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hope is that the new owners can inject more money into the club and propel Newcastle back to the top of English football.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe takeover has been rumbling on for months with other investors reportedly interested in buying the club. Before a takeover goes through, any successful bid must pass English footballâ\\x80\\x99s Ownersâ\\x80\\x99 and Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 test.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf the fans have faith in the owners then that builds trust and trust builds time,â\\x80\\x9d Kieran Maguire, a university lecturer on football finance and author of The Price of Football, tells CNN Sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf it was me [as a new owner], the focus would be to have a strategy, have a director of football who can therefore say, â\\x80\\x98This is the way that Newcastle United is going to go forwards, this is going to be our style of play in conjunction with the manager.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the dull stuff, itâ\\x80\\x99s the back office, the business operations that I would address first. Fans are looking for a marquee signing [but] I would say that just signing for the sake of signing is a way to waste money.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nChelsea and Manchester City set the trend for courting big-name signings following takeovers by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mansour respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), in particular, was quick to throw money at City. Maguire says the club spent Â£62 million ($77 million) on transfers in 2008, the summer after Sheikh Mansour took charge, which included breaking the British transfer record in the purchase of Brazilian forward Robinho.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was about 12 times what the club had spent the previous year, and Cityâ\\x80\\x99s outgoings on players only grew in the years that followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo seasons later, the likes of David Silva, Yaya TourÃ©, Mario Balotelli and Edin DÅ¾eko were all brought in as, according to Maguire, Â£165 million ($204 million) was splashed on transfers in 2011; the season after that came Sergio Aguero, who helped deliver City its first league title for more than 40 years in dramatic fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is known that wealthier clubs are more successful over the long term than their rivals with fewer resources,â\\x80\\x9d Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at data company Gracenote, tells CNN Sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen the current owners took full control in 2008, Manchester City were outside the top 20 richest clubs, and not amongst England\\'s six wealthiest teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe investment made by the owners made Manchester City competitive in the transfer market with the top English clubs, improving the team to the point that they could regularly challenge for trophies.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn comparison to other English top-flight teams, Mike Ashleyâ\\x80\\x99s limited investment in Newcastle has seen the club twice drop into the Championship and seldom finish in the Premier League\\'s top half. Manchester Cityâ\\x80\\x99s Abu Dhabi owners invested heavily in player signings after taking over the club in 2008. Four Premier League titles have been won since, though the Champions League trophy has proved elusive. The dominant force in French football, PSG has failed to top Ligue 1 only twice since the Qatari owners bought the club. Much like City, PSG\\'s domestic hegemony hasn\\'t translated into European success.\\r\\n\\r\\nGleave also notes that City was rated the 68th best team in Europe when ADUG took over according to Gracenoteâ\\x80\\x99s Euro Club Index, which ranks all European football clubs based on competition results over a four-year period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club has risen up the pecking order under a number of different managers since then, before acquiring the top spot under Pep Guardiola in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the chances of Newcastle matching the sort of spending that propelled City to success are remote given the restrictions football clubs must adhere to.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Premier League, a club can make losses of up to $130 million over three seasons and $33 million over three years for UEFA competitions. On Thursday, UEFA eased its regulations for one year due to Covid-19.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latterâ\\x80\\x99s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations wonâ\\x80\\x99t immediately apply to Newcastle, but the club will need to be compliant if it wishes to compete in Europe in the near future as UEFAâ\\x80\\x99s checks date back three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you take a look at both Manchester City and Chelsea when they were acquired by Sheikh Mansour and Abramovich, the initial transfer policy was scattergun and it was very hit and miss,â\\x80\\x9d says Maguire.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe advantage that both Chelsea and Manchester City had was that both clubs were operating in the pre-Financial Fair Play environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlthough I think Newcastle [might] have opportunity to spend more money than they have historically, they canâ\\x80\\x99t just spend Â£100 million ($124 million) and write it off as easily as Chelsea and Manchester City were able to do back in the pre-Financial Fair Play days.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMoney spent on stadium infrastructure, a clubâ\\x80\\x99s academy, its womenâ\\x80\\x99s team, or community projects falls outside spending restrictions. Cityâ\\x80\\x99s Abu Dhabi owners have been able to invest in a state-of-the-art academy stadium and training facilities around the Etihad Stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLike any new owners coming in, it\\'ll be important that [Newcastle] have got the right people to give them the right advice to make sure they\\'re spending their money as cleverly as possible â\\x80¦ to maximize every pound that they are going to invest in,â\\x80\\x9d sports lawyer Daniel Geey tells CNN Sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyone expecting owners to come in even with very deep pockets and to spend like, for example, Roman Abramovich did, or Sheikh Mansour has done with Manchester City â\\x80\\x93 I think those days are a little bit behind the Premier League.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a well-run club financially.â\\x80\\x9d Kieran Maguire\\r\\n\\r\\nNewcastle may also benefit from Ashleyâ\\x80\\x99s frugal ownership if the new consortium purchases the club.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf heâ\\x80\\x99d been fairly loose with the cash, it could be that the new owners would inherit a club where they could only go and spend an extra Â£20 million ($24.5 million) next season because the losses from the last couple of years were so high,â\\x80\\x9d explains Maguire.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut in the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a well-run club financially. Which means of that Â£105 million ($130 million) loss, all of that is practically available to the new owners immediately.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOverspending does have consequences. City has been banned from the Champions League for the next two seasons for contravening FFP rules, although the club has called the charges â\\x80\\x9centirely falseâ\\x80\\x9d and is appealing the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport is due to announce its decision on Cityâ\\x80\\x99s appeal in early July.\\r\\n\\r\\nNasser Al-Khelaifi, the president of French side Paris Saint-Germain, which is owned by sovereign wealth fund Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), has also been investigated by UEFA for illegal spending.\\r\\n\\r\\nPSG has won the Ligue 1 title seven times since QSI took control of the club in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt smashed the transfer record by signing Neymar Jr. for $263 million from Barcelona in 2017, the same window that Kylian Mbappe also joined from AS Monaco.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn investigation launched in September 2017 to determine whether PSG had contravened FFP regulations was concluded last year when CAS upheld PSGâ\\x80\\x99s appeal against the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, for all their domestic success, neither City nor PSG have attained the same heights in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCity lost to English rivals Liverpool and Tottenham in the final eight of the past two seasons, while PSG has fallen in the round of 16 in the past three campaigns, never reaching the semifinals under the Qatari owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thereâ\\x80\\x99s little doubt that long term investment in a football club can yield returns, particularly in Englandâ\\x80\\x99s top-flight league.\\r\\n\\r\\nCity is today part of City Football Group (CFG), a global network of associated clubs which includes teams in the United States, Australia, Japan and Uruguay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally owned solely by ADUG, the China Media Capital consortium bought a 13% stake for $400 million in December 2015, while US private equity giant Silver Lake acquired just over 10% of CFG for $500 million last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Manchester City model, which is to buy lots of clubs around the world, is proving to be of benefit to them,â\\x80\\x9d says Maguire.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery much the case at present is that Manchester City is the mothership and if they identify a good player in Spain or Uruguay or Australia or New York or wherever, that individual could then potentially be acquired by Manchester City at a very reasonable fee at a later point in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a good strategy and I think it will reap its rewards in due course.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the Abu Dhabi owners are 12 years down the line with City. The Newcastle deal is yet to be processed and has come under intense scrutiny since news of the potential ownership change surfaced.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman rights group Amnesty argued that Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s interest in Newcastle serves as â\\x80\\x9ca PR tool to distract from the country\\'s abysmal human rights record,\" while Hatice Cengiz, the fiancÃ©e of late journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said the takeover would â\\x80\\x9cstainâ\\x80\\x9d the Premier League.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, Khashoggiâ\\x80\\x99s children publicly forgave their father\\'s killers, sparing five government agents the death penalty. The CIA concluded in 2018 that bin Salman personally ordered Khashoggi\\'s murder, which the crown prince denies.\\r\\n\\r\\nQatari-based media giant beIN Media Group has also voiced concerns about the proposed takeover given Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s alleged role in illegally streaming football matches.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeIN CEO Yousef Al-Obaidly wrote to the Premier League, alluding to the \"direct role\" Saudi Arabia has had in the \"launch, promotion and operation\" of alleged pirate streaming service beoutQ.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this week, the World Trade Organization ruled that Saudi Arabia had acted unlawfully in relation to beoutQ\\'s operation, a decision that was welcomed by UEFA.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Premier League rules, owners of clubs can be disqualified if they donâ\\x80\\x99t pass the Ownersâ\\x80\\x99 and Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 test before acquiring a club.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Newcastle and the Premier League declined to comment when contacted by CNN in relation to the takeover.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PIF and Saudi officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the takeover and criticism from Amnesty and Cengiz, while the Saudi Ministry of Media did not respond to the piracy claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the new consortium will successfully purchase Newcastle hangs in the balance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the deal goes through, there will be an expectation the Magpies punch above their mid-table performances of recent seasons. But given the competitive nature of the Premier League, success is unlikely to come quickly or easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think the new owners will be able to bridge that gap [with the leagueâ\\x80\\x99s top teams], but part of the reason that gap exists is because the other clubs are global brands,â\\x80\\x9d says Maguire.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will take time for Newcastle to expand their influence on a more global sphere. But if they can qualify for Europe on a couple of occasions then they will become Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s local club, as it were.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Frozen in Time Forty five years ago, eight Soviet women climbers were pinned on top of a high mountain in the USSR in the worst storm in 25 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was June 1974. The Cold War was verging on dÃ©tente, though the Watergate scandal overshadowed the Moscow Summit between President Richard Nixon and his Soviet Union counterpart, Leonid Brezhnev.\\r\\n\\r\\nA month later, thousands of miles away in Central Asia, close to the Himalayas in the shadow of Peak Lenin, another meeting took place between an American and a Russian.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet Union Iran India China Soviet Union Iran Saudi Arabia India China Mongolia The map reflects modern-day geography; the Soviet Union border is based on the borders of the countries that were part of the USSR. Map credits: maps4news.com/Â©OSM, Encyclopedia Britannica In 1974, 170 climbers from a number of countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp in the southern part of the Soviet Union, on the border of what is now Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. They camped in the Pamir Mountains, or Pamirs, a range with some of the world\\'s highest mountains. Many would climb or attempt the 7,134 meter (23,406ft) Peak Lenin. While not considered steep or technical, it is high and subject to severe weather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMolly Higgins first saw Elvira Shatayeva as she came around a bend in the High Pamirs mountain range, sometimes known as â\\x80\\x9cthe roof of the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Outward Bound instructor traveling the Colorado Rockies, living out of a faded white sedan, Higgins had been asked to a month-long international mountaineering gathering hosted by the Russians.\\r\\n\\r\\nNineteen Americans, including two women, attended as part of the 1974 American Pamirs / USSR Expedition. Higgins, then 24, was a last-minute invitee when organizers, many unsure or uneasy about quite where women fit in on expeditions, realized that one woman did not seem like enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was ambitious and very self-confident, and I thought I was very strong,â\\x80\\x9d recalls Higgins, now a clinical laboratory scientist in Whitefish, Montana.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was with a crew carrying loads up to Camp II -- Crevasse Camp -- toward Krylenko Pass on the shoulder of Peak Lenin, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s second-highest mountain, when an earthquake shook the slopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiggins remembers a creaking sound. Then an avalanche roared overhead, launching off the top of an ice tower above camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe avalanche darkened the air, scattered gear, and partially buried one person, with at least two others jumping into the crevasse to escape. Four among the crew had descended earlier to resupply, and for hours those in both groups dreaded that the others had died.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet all had survived, though in the lower group Allen Steck, a pioneering climber from Berkeley, California, was buried up to his neck. The two groups joyfully reunited at Camp 1, on the Krylenko moraine, and retreated, shaken, to base camp in an alpine meadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome 170 climbers from 10 Western countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp, with another 60 Eastern European and Russian climbers and officials across a stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the first major American expedition allowed in the Soviet Union, which has some of the highest and most remote mountains in the world. The gathering was held to showcase the region and the skills of the host climbers and, it seemed, develop relationships with Cold War rivals. It was seen as a means to bring up young mountaineers and foster mountaineering relations between countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeet the climbers\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one could ever have imagined how many things would go wrong that summer, events rained down by the skies and upthrust by the earth, nor the heroics that would ensue.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the story of one of the greatest disasters in all of mountaineering has been almost completely lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven many non-climbers know of Everest disasters and who Alex Honnold is. Yet almost no one today, climbers included, has ever heard about what befell eight Russian women in 1974. A Google search turns up nothing about the 45th anniversary last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is injured!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDescribing the retreat after the calamitous avalanche, Higgins says: â\\x80\\x9cWe came down through these huge boulders, around a corner, and there, standing up, was this absolutely gorgeous, bright-blue-eyed, muscular, bossy hottie on a boulder, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s got about four Russian guys around her, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s ordering them around.â\\x80\\x9d The woman was in her mid-30s.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpotting that an American, Mike Yokell, was limping -- after jumping into the crevasse beside Camp II to escape the avalanche -- Shatayeva called out, â\\x80\\x9cHe is injured! Take his pack!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShatayeva then wheeled around, looked at Higgins, and said in deep, careful tones, â\\x80\\x9cI am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMaster of Sport was the top credential in any sport in the status-aware Soviet Union, even more impressive when attained by a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiggins recalls: â\\x80\\x9cI thought it was great. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to be bossy like that, but here was a woman who really was capable. I wanted to be like her, that strong and that experienced. She was a heroine, right there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an era of relatively few women climbers, Higgins had never met one who was the kind of climber and mountaineer she wanted to be. It was to be the young Americanâ\\x80\\x99s only interaction with Elvira.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew right then that it was a transforming moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAwkward dynamic\\r\\n\\r\\nArlene Blum, a biophysical chemist and environmentalist from Berkeley, California, had applied to the American Alpine Club to join the American contingent, but was declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some Swiss climbers, through an international womenâ\\x80\\x99s climbing club, brought her in on their invitation to be part of a womenâ\\x80\\x99s team. The situation created an awkward dynamic when Blum, 29, arrived in the Pamirs and entered the jam-packed mess tent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she told the story in her memoir â\\x80\\x9cBreaking Trail,â\\x80\\x9d she approached the crowded American table, but was ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote, â\\x80\\x9cI stood amid the roar of voices, holding my bread and caviar and wishing I could disappear. Blessedly, a striking blonde Russian woman waved me over to her table.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShatayeva introduced herself and welcomed Blum. As they talked, she told Blum that most Soviet men thought a womenâ\\x80\\x99s team would never succeed on the 23,406-foot Peak Lenin â\\x80\\x94 her groupâ\\x80\\x99s aim.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe plan to be the first womenâ\\x80\\x99s team to do it,â\\x80\\x9d said Shatayeva. â\\x80\\x9cOr maybe your group will be.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlum, put at ease, said, â\\x80\\x9cMaybe we could all climb together.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is impossibleâ\\x80\\x9d was the swift reply. Blum could only surmise that the Soviets wanted the first womenâ\\x80\\x99s team to be their own. Shatayeva told Blum the larger plan: that the eight women would climb the peak by the Lipkin Ridge on the northeast side and descend the northwest ridge toward the smaller Razdelny Peak. Theirs would be the first traverse, by men or women, of the peak. They were to bivouac, or make a temporary camp, on top.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSoviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.â\\x80\\x9d Elvira Shatayeva, July 15, 1974.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe will succeed,â\\x80\\x9d she told Blum. â\\x80\\x9cSoviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlum today recalls Shatayevaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cwarmth and energy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shared a common goal of giving women the chance to climb high mountains and were so happy to be in this camp with other climbers who shared our delight in the mountains,â\\x80\\x9d Blum reminisces.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remembers feeling some concern about the ambitious plan to traverse Peak Lenin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis was in the days of the Cold War, when we were in competition with the Russians. I looked at their inadequate tents with button closures and [their] old-fashioned boots and thought how the Russian technology seemed to be going more into space than the mountains.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCat-like blue eyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher Wren, a climber and Moscow correspondent for the New York Times (he was to become bureau chief in December of that year), met Shatayeva in base camp early in the meet, which commenced in mid-July.\\r\\n\\r\\nA passage (later anthologized) from his book â\\x80\\x9cThe End of the Line,â\\x80\\x9d about his years in Russia and China, read: â\\x80\\x9cA striking blonde with high cheekbones and cat-like blue eyes, she had come there to lead a team of the Soviet Unionâ\\x80\\x99s best women climbers in an assault on Lenin Peak.â\\x80\\x9d Chatting with her over tea, he sensed a â\\x80\\x9csteel coreâ\\x80\\x9d beneath the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next time Wren saw Shatayeva was as he and two friends approached the top of Peak Lenin after a storm-blasted, two-night bivouac 1,000 feet below the summit, and spotted a splash of color, a blue jacket in a snow hollow.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomeone,â\\x80\\x9d he would write of that confused first impression, â\\x80\\x9cseemed to be lying asleep in the bright sunshine.â\\x80\\x9d He thought, An odd time for a nap.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisciplined unit\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert â\\x80\\x9cBobâ\\x80\\x9d Craig (who died in 2015, at 90), deputy leader for the American team and author of the subsequent expedition book, â\\x80\\x9cStorm and Sorrow,â\\x80\\x9d wrote: â\\x80\\x9cFor the most part, the women remained across the creek in the â\\x80\\x98Soviet Nationalitiesâ\\x80\\x99 camp. They made several practice climbs, and we observed them a couple of times doing calisthenics in front of their tents.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women, whom he described as aged 22 to 35, appeared to be â\\x80\\x9cvery serious â\\x80¦ still they sang songs together, and not infrequently we would hear their excited chattering and their laughter tinkling like bells across the valley.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nElviraâ\\x80\\x99s husband, Vladimir Shatayev, later wrote in his memoir, â\\x80\\x9cDegrees of Difficulty,â\\x80\\x9d that the women operated as a disciplined yet congenial unit. â\\x80\\x9cNot once did we hear words of argument or contention.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told him, â\\x80\\x9cYou should read the minutesâ\\x80\\x9d of their meetings. â\\x80\\x9cYou men have never dreamed of such openness.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShatayeva had already organized the first all-womenâ\\x80\\x99s ascent of a 7,000-meter peak â\\x80\\x94 Peak Korzhenevskaya (7,105 meters) -- in Tajikistan in 1972, and led a traverse of the double-summitted Ushba (4,710 meters) in Georgia the following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo nights before the women set out, the American climbers Jed Williamson and Peter Lev strolled over to their camp to say hello and good luck. In a country of regulations, as Williamson, now a retired college president living in Hanover, New Hampshire, says, â\\x80\\x9cIt was the first time they were allowed to go without the company of men.â\\x80\\x9d Four of the women had climbed Peak Lenin with males.\\r\\n\\r\\nDire natural circumstances\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no one could control weather or geology. The whole Pamirs meet was plagued by snow, rapidly developing avalanche hazard, an earthquake that shook avalanches down (with two more quakes later), and the worst storm seen in the region in 25 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 1:00 a.m. on July 26, barely more than a day after Higgins and her group returned from Krylenko Pass, four climbers forging a new route on the north face of Peak of the 19th Party Congress (or Peak 19) were hit by an avalanche as they slept. Craig, the deputy leader for the American team, and his tent mate, Jon Gary Ullin, were buried. Ullin, 31, an affable and humorous airline pilot from Seattle, was crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir friends John Roskelley and John Marts had excavated both and tried to resuscitate Ullin when yet another avalanche hit, enveloping Craig again and sweeping away the tents and equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoskelley, Marts and Craig were then stranded in a snow cave for two days and dropped supplies in a superb collaborative helicopter rescue effort by the Soviets, who allowed Lev a key role as â\\x80\\x9cdrop person,â\\x80\\x9d in which he had experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nLev, an avalanche forecaster and heli-ski guide, recalls the Russian helicopter being extremely powerful. â\\x80\\x9cI was in the large open door, just hanging onto something,â\\x80\\x9d he says, â\\x80\\x9cand was able to get the drop â\\x80\\x98on their doorstepâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d from about 50 or 75 feet above.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe pilot deserves real credit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFive climbers who were not part of the meet and known to visitors only as â\\x80\\x9cthe Estoniansâ\\x80\\x9d went missing on the East Face of Peak Lenin. Three were found to have died in an avalanche, and the other two were rescued and survived. Many accounts incorrectly say all five died.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most in the assemblage, objectives changed in accordance with the conditions; although Roskelley and Jeff Lowe returned and completed the line up Peak 19, other climbers converged on the â\\x80\\x9cstandardâ\\x80\\x9d routes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Higgins, while feeling lonely and isolated among the mostly male contingent, ended up in a group of four (herself; the expedition leader, Pete Schoening; Chris Kopczynski; and Frank Sarnquist) that climbed Peak Lenin via the Razdelny ridge on August 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other American woman on the meet, the much-respected Marty Hoey -- who tragically died on Everest eight years later â\\x80\\x93 also climbed the Razdelny side, with Lev, Bruce Carson and John Evans on August 4. Williamson started with them but, feeling ill, turned back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the mountain is not considered steep or technical, it is big and high and beset by challenging weather conditions, with sections of moderately steep ice, especially high on the Lipkin side.\\r\\n\\r\\nElvira Shatayeva and the Russian women made final preparations for Peak Lenin climb. July 30 - The Russian womenâ\\x80\\x99s team left Base Camp for Camp I. July 31 - The team took the Lipkin route and proceeded toward the summit without any problems. On August 3, Shatayeva called a rest day. August 3 â\\x80\\x93 An American team of climbers behind the Russian women reported: â\\x80\\x9cCloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions.â\\x80\\x9d August 4 - A major storm was forecast, and organizers recommended all climbers descend. The Russian women were seen walking in a line perhaps 400 feet below the summit. August 5 - The Russian womenâ\\x80\\x99s team radioed from the summit. August 6 - The women tried to descend but only managed a few hundred feet. Speaking to base then and August 7, they reported their struggles. Their final transmission came through at 20:30. August 8 - The storm was over. From their final camp, located about 400 meters below the summit, the American team set out for the summit with no idea of the events that had occurred above.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur summit day was so hard I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it,â\\x80\\x9d Higgins says. â\\x80\\x9cThe altitude â\\x80¦ I did some collapsing. It was a really humbling experience. I was very proud of it and so glad it was done.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff Lowe, a standout young climber (who died of natural causes in 2018), would much later post in an online thread: â\\x80\\x9c[S]ome of the guys on the trip gave her a hard time, claiming she didn\\'t have enough [expedition or alpine] experience to be there. Molly proved them wrong, though -- pulling her own weight and generally comporting herself in a competent manner.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 3, Steck moved up on the Lipkin side with Wren and Jock Glidden. Steck wrote in his diary, as reported in his 2017 memoir, â\\x80\\x9cA Mountaineerâ\\x80\\x99s Lifeâ\\x80\\x9d: â\\x80\\x9cCloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions. Our altimeter tells us we are at about 5,800 meters,â\\x80\\x9d or 19,030 feet. On August 4, the three took a layover day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Americansâ\\x80\\x99 radios had been impounded in customs, so Steckâ\\x80\\x99s group had only a weak radio on loan from the Soviets, and all countries had been put on different frequencies. That day, a major storm was forecast, and Vitaly Abalakov -- Master of Sport for mountaineering in the whole country (who died in 1986) -- recommended that all climbers descend to base. Steckâ\\x80\\x99s group never received the message, nor did Richard Alan North of Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur summit day was so hard I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it.â\\x80\\x9d Molly Higgins, May 5, 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom July 31 to August 3, North, a biomedical scientist now retired and living in Niwot, Colorado, and teammates moved up a â\\x80\\x9cnew though not particularly difficultâ\\x80\\x9d route to join the Lipkin route.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 4, by then climbing alone, North cut steps, as was commonly done in the era, in the steepening ice -- tedious, tiring work accompanied by altitude-induced hallucinations. He reached the top and then descended, slipping a few times and gripping his ice axe for self-arrest on the hard snow. At the foot of the steep section, perhaps 400 feet below the summit, he met the Russian women, walking in a line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was windy, with visibility â\\x80\\x9cjust a few meters,â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey exchanged greetings, and North was later to recreate the scene in Summit magazine, writing: â\\x80\\x9cThey are moving slowly up but in high spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You get a bit short of breath up there,â\\x80\\x99 I remark jokingly. But the humor is lost on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ah! We are strong. We are women,â\\x80\\x99 they reply.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth descended, passing some Soviet men who summited behind him and later joined his descent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe believes the women climbed the steep icy section and camped that night on the eastern edge of the summit ridge, before moving to the summit the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of August 5, on the somewhat more straightforward Razdelny side, a Soviet climber came to Blumâ\\x80\\x99s tent at Camp III, the top camp, with a message from base saying, â\\x80\\x9cA storm is predicted. Do not try to climb.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, the air remained calm and fairly clear, people had come a long way and were in position, and some chose to try. Blum, Heidi LÃ¼di and Eva Isenschmid of Switzerland started up, though the latter two carried extra gear and planned on a possible bivouac, so Blum hastened ahead, with a turnaround time in mind and hoping to beat any weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearing the top when the storm hit shortly before noon, Blum retreated, soon fighting the wind and blizzard. She was fortunately joined by Williamson, who had started up for the summit again, also with a firm turnaround limit and an eye on the weather. He had retreated from very high -- the summit plateau at 22,800 feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamson broke trail and urged Blum on when she sat, exhausted. On the way down the pair saw Blumâ\\x80\\x99s two teammates and a Bavarian woman friend and entreated them to descend as well; Isenschmid, a 23-year-old photographer and artist whom North calls a â\\x80\\x9cgentle soul,â\\x80\\x9d was to die in the storm the next day despite strenuous rescue efforts from her partners and French, German and American climbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Steck, Wren and Glidden hiked up to just below the major ridge and in wild storm conditions stopped and camped at 22,000 feet, their Camp IV, the final one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet womenâ\\x80\\x99s team summitted late afternoon on August 5, carrying full loads (climbers not on a traverse can leave some gear below). At 5:00 p.m. they radioed base camp and said that in the deteriorating visibility they were having difficulty making out the descent and had set up their tents to wait for a break.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccounts of the ensuing events differ, but Vladimir Shatayev in his book notes that base camp agreed, saying to descend immediately if possible or wait the night. Craigâ\\x80\\x99s book reports that Abalakov told them to descend first thing in the morning on the Lipkin, the route they had ascended and knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night Steckâ\\x80\\x99s group wore their boots and all clothing to bed in case their tent shredded. The Americans had nylon tents with zippers and aluminum poles. Holding up the tent poles, though one snapped, they would outlast the storm. The Soviet women had cotton tents with toggle closures and wooden poles, and according to Craig the wind wrecked two tents the first night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning of August 6 brought five inches of snow at base and, higher, a foot of snow and winds of 70 to 80 mph. Climbers gathered to hear radio transmissions by translator as Shatayeva radioed reports of the sustained whiteout and worsening wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt what Vladimir Shatayev states as 5:00 p.m. (though Craig indicates as some hours earlier), Shatayeva reported that one woman had become ill and another seemed unwell. Abalakov told them to descend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbalakov spoke slowly and adamantly, according to Craig, saying to reach snow in which they could dig caves.\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig wrote, â\\x80\\x9c[I]t was implied that if the sick girl could not move and they could not achieve adequate shelter, they must leave her for the good of the group as a whole.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the women descended, Irina Lyubimtseva died, apparently freezing to death holding a safety rope for others.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnable to dig caves in the hard, granular snow, the women somehow managed to put up two tents on a ridge only several hundred feet below the top. The ailing climbers deteriorated. Abalakov strongly directed continued descent by those who could move, according to Craig; Shatayeva said she understood and would try.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe times given vary, but that day or into the next, the ill women (Nina Vasilyeva and Valenina Fateyeva) died. Also that day or, by Shatayevâ\\x80\\x99s account in the early hours after midnight, hurricane-force winds hit, exploding the tents and blowing away rucksacks, stoves and mittens. Five women huddled in a tent without poles, with three sleeping bags.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning four Japanese climbers, bivouacked in a tent at 6,500 meters on the Lipkin side and possessing a strong radio, heard the transmissions in Russian and deduced trouble. Two of the Japanese climbers bravely set out to help but were blown off their feet and forced back. Other climbers on the mountain mobilized, but all were far lower.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease forgive us. We love you. Goodbye. When will we see the flowers again?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final hours\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following excerpts are from Craig. Accounts and times differ somewhat, but Craig was in base camp and overall his account is considered sound, and an honest, earnest rendition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 7, â\\x80\\x9caboutâ\\x80\\x9d 08:00. Abalakov pressed Shatayeva as to whether the women were trying to descend. She replied with spirit: â\\x80\\x9cThree more are sick; now there are only two of us who are functioning, and we are getting weaker. We cannot, we would not leave our comrades after all they have done for us.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 Shatayeva: â\\x80\\x9cIt is very sad here where it was once so beautiful.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNoon. One more had died, two were dying. â\\x80\\x9cThey are all gone now. That last asked, â\\x80\\x98When will we see the flowers again?â\\x80\\x99 [Two] others earlier asked about [their] children. Now it is no use.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n15:30 [Disoriented] â\\x80\\x9cWe are sorry, we have failed you. We tried so hard. Now we are so cold.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAbalakov in despair promised a rescue was underway.\\r\\n\\r\\n17:00 Transmission unclear, but another woman seemed to have died. Three remained. Winds up high were estimated at 80 to 100 mph, the summit temperatures as minus 30 to minus 40 F.\\r\\n\\r\\n18:30 â\\x80\\x9cAnother has died. We cannot go through another night. I do not have the strength to hold down the transmitter button.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n20:30 â\\x80\\x9cNow we are two. And now we will all die. We are very sorry. We tried but we could not â\\x80¦ Please forgive us. We love you. Goodbye.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVladimir Shatayevâ\\x80\\x99s book identifies the last speaker not as his wife but Galina Perehodyuk, and suggests it was difficult to understand whether the word was â\\x80\\x9cforgiveâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9crequest.â\\x80\\x9d He writes that twice more someone pressed the radio button, attempting contact with the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteck says, â\\x80\\x9cThe events of that day are permanently etched into my brain.â\\x80\\x9d On August 8 the American trio, unprepared, saw the first body on the face below the summit; Wren recognized Shatayeva. Signs of others were visible upslope. The four Japanese arrived at the same time, and the Americans borrowed their radio to call base, with Steck saying, â\\x80\\x9cSomething very strange, very sad has happened here.â\\x80\\x9d Finding the other bodies above, they walked crying among them, amid the shreds of tent fabric and shards of poles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond Shatayeva, two women were half-buried in the snow; three, as Wren was to write in the New York Times, â\\x80\\x9csprawled across a torn tent, futilely pitched on a scoopedâ\\x80\\x90out snow platform,â\\x80\\x9d and another was frozen holding a rope leading downhill. The eighth was to be found beneath the others when Elviraâ\\x80\\x99s husband and a support crew went up a week later to retrieve them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night at camp all three Americans were certain they heard womenâ\\x80\\x99s voices. â\\x80\\x9cRussian voices,â\\x80\\x9d says Steck. â\\x80\\x9cWe\\'d open the tent and no one was there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reasons for the mass tragedy are many, sifted through with the benefit of hindsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe objective, as a traverse, put the women as camping on the summit, exposed to the worst of the storm. They had poor equipment. They were also under pressure, on show.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey were the test group,â\\x80\\x9d says Higgins. â\\x80\\x9cThey felt they needed to do it to uphold the standards of the womenâ\\x80\\x99s team.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWren wrote, â\\x80\\x9cRather than retreat when the storm came in, they made a miscalculation to wait until the visibility improved. I suspect that they did not want foreigners to think Russians were quitters.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMany observed that Shatayeva felt great responsibility for her team.\\r\\n\\r\\nSays Blum: â\\x80\\x9cThe women were so very loyal to each other. They stayed together until the end.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHiggins expresses regret, respect and conflicting feelings over the series of events.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould it have been braver to say, â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s save the five of us?â\\x80\\x99... I just think it was really sad. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve felt,â\\x80\\x9d she says honestly, â\\x80\\x9cthat she should have taken who she could and gotten out of there.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is huge,â\\x80\\x9d she says feelingly of such a quandary. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a mortal decision.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth, the last person to see the women alive (some accounts mistakenly have Scottish and Japanese climbers on the summit with them), says, â\\x80\\x9cYou could call them victims of circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think without the international meet they would have been in that situation, in that weather. Same with Eva and Heidi. Because there were so many nations taking part and the overall world situation at that time, it was unusual to be there, so there was a bit of an element of people wanting to represent their nations that does not exist in normal mountaineering situations.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Evans (who has just died, January 9), in a published journal, â\\x80\\x9cThe Pamirs: Russia,â\\x80\\x9d called the many fatalities â\\x80\\x9can extraordinarily sorrowful statistic â\\x80¦ made even more distressing in the light of the very optimistic and positive intentions of our Russian hosts.â\\x80\\x9d Thirteen were lost: the three Estonians, Jon Gary Ullin, Eva Isenschmid and the eight Russian women.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnguished and noble\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamson, in Camp III on Razdelny during the storm, says: â\\x80\\x9cThey werenâ\\x80\\x99t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration. Iâ\\x80\\x99m just sad those conditions came together. The storm came in pretty fast and went fast. Two days later it was bluebird skies, and we were in shirtsleeves.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crucial decision was the one to stay on the summit. Still, a major turning point may have occurred days earlier, in that era when women climbers were often doubted and excluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Peak Lenin, Shatayeva had at first welcomed the snow, on August 4 telling Vladimir by radio, â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s goodâ\\x80\\x94it covers the tracks. So that there wonâ\\x80\\x99t be talk that we ascended along a trailâ\\x80\\x9d made by others.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearing the main ridge August 2, Shatayeva had radioed, â\\x80\\x9cEverything so far is so good that weâ\\x80\\x99re disappointed in the route.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYet August 3 she called a rest day. Three teams of Soviet men, one of which summitted August 4, were near, clearly coordinated to provide support if needed. Vladimir Shatayev wrote, â\\x80\\x9cThe possibility cannot be ruled out that it was precisely for this reason that the women were dragging out the climb, trying to break loose from the guardianship.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHad they reached the top one day earlier, they would have been lower when the storm hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey werenâ\\x80\\x99t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration.â\\x80\\x9d Jed Williamson, June 23, 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, 45 years on, women have long proved themselves in climbing and mountaineering, are widely visible on the crags and in the peaks, and accepted as peers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tale of the Russian women climbers is, as Higgins puts it, â\\x80\\x9cone of the epic sad stories in modern climbing history.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the meet, different countries worked together in disastrous and even surreal circumstances. Other people had known the Russian women to be, as Blum put it in her book, â\\x80\\x9cjubilantâ\\x80\\x9d on the mountain, and then witnessed an anguished and noble end.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is so enormously tragic, occurring at a time when more women were beginning to brave great challenges on rock and in mountains,â\\x80\\x9d Higgins says. \"I wanted to be one of those women, and Elvira seemed invincible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlison Osius of Carbondale, Colorado, is an editor at Rock and Ice magazine.

       " '(CNN) Muscles aching after an afternoon gym session, Tayla Harris is spending the early evening hanging laundry in the backyard of her Melbourne home. \"Pretty standard procedure,\" says the athlete who has experienced a far from ordinary 12 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil last March, Harris was admired by many yet not widely recognized. As a young player in the women\\'s Australian Football League (AFLW), a summer sport that is an Australian obsession, her focus had been on flourishing professionally in two sports -- on making a name for herself on the football field and, during the off season, in the boxing ring, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a picture posted on Facebook last year of Harris playing for her team Carlton Blues elevated the then 21-year-old beyond the world of sport. She became one of the most talked-about sportswomen on the planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst came the vile messages, and they came thick and fast -- sexist, disturbing and damaging comments posted below a now iconic picture of Harris doing her job.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris\\' fearless response was then shared by thousands on social media, prompting celebrities, and even Australia\\'s Prime Minister, to voice their support. She had stood up and spoken out. It changed her world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would be happy to go through it all again, but I\\'d rather not,\" says Harris.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith one tweet Harris had made a lasting impression in the usually transitory world of social media, while the photograph is now a symbol of defiance. T-shirts with her silhouette can be bought and a bronze statue of her was unveiled on Australian Women\\'s Day in September.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love it when a mum or a young daughter and son says to me \\'thanks for standing up to what you stood up for,\\'\" Harris tells CNN Sport.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my example is going to help someone in any way, I would be happy to go through it all again. I\\'d rather not, but there\\'s been so many amazing messages. It\\'s been an eye-opening experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Here\\'s a picture of me at work\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the opening minutes of the AFLW\\'s Pride Game between the Western Bulldogs and Carlton on March 17, 2019, and Harris, the Blues\\' forward, has kicked the first goal of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotographer Michael Willson has brilliantly captured the athleticism of the act: she is mid-air, looking to her left, focusing on the trajectory of a ball which is out of shot. So gymnastically high is her right leg, her right foot is above her head. While a few feet from the ground, she is almost doing the splits.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat followed is said to have changed the landscape of women\\'s sport in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nPosting the picture on its 7AFL Facebook page, Australian broadcaster Channel 7 captions it \"photo of the year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\\'s a pic of me at work... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals. pic.twitter.com/68aBVVbTTj â\\x80\\x94 Tayla Harris (@taylaharriss) March 19, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nFew could have foreseen that the number of, in the broadcaster\\'s words, \"inappropriate and offensive\" comments would lead to Channel 7 deleting the post 24 hours later because, it said, the messages had become difficult to monitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut erasing a picture that showcased the prowess of the women\\'s game caused more damage. After all, such an act does not silence trolls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE PHOTO,\" tweeted Sam Kerr, one of the world\\'s best female soccer players, echoing the thoughts of many. A few hours later, the hashtag \"Tayla\" was trending on Twitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, Harris was at home getting ready for bed, \"just doing my thing,\" she says, when her phone started pinging. One notification rapidly following another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t think \\'oh, this is a really personal attack,\" Harris explains. \"I just thought, obviously this is a much bigger issue than just saying sexist things to people. It\\'s actually the start of something much worse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a phone conversation with the chief executive of a national project which aims to eliminate domestic and family violence, Harris proceeded to post a message which became the most liked tweet of 2019 in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s a picture of me at work ... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals,\" Harris wrote. The tweet remains pinned at the top of her profile page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I saw a little picture on Facebook and I\\'d see a young girl with a man who has made these comments, it was horrifying to think that this girl had to live, or be around someone, who is able to actually say these things. I thought about it in depth,\" Harris continues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I responded after an hour or two. I thought \\'I have the photo, so I\\'ll just put it up and just chuck that caption on\\' and what happened, happened. I didn\\'t put it up as a f**k you to Channel 7, I just put it up because I thought it was a cool photo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris speaks next to Carlton CEO Cain Liddle during a press conference at Ikon Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris went to bed with around 20,000 Twitter followers but by the next morning had an additional 60,000. There was an apology from Channel 7 for sending \"the wrong message\" by removing the photo from its social media accounts, while Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the trolls \"cowardly grubs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a weekend match looming, Harris restricted herself to one radio interview in the immediate aftermath, during which she described the comments as sexual abuse, and held a press conference to sate the appetite of media organizations around the world. Carlton provided her with a security guard for the next game, against Fremantle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surreal,\" and a \"roller-coaster\" is how she sums up the week. \"For the most part it was all positive,\" she adds, \"but I had to check in with myself and make sure this was something I was OK with because it was a really full on and busy, confronting few weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The really important thing for me was not to dilute the messaging or say something that could be misinterpreted, so I made sure I was really clear and articulate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand Harris\\' inner strength, we must step back in time, to the first decade of the century when the self-confessed daddy\\'s girl was growing up in the northern suburbs of Brisbane and towering above her elementary schoolmates. She would grow to become 5ft 10in.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father Warren, a marine mechanic whom Harris describes as her best friend, encouraged his daughter to partake in whatever activity she wanted -- skateboarding, building boats, self defense, Aussie Rules -- and with such freedom came confidence and, significantly, courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I see someone suffering or needing help, I\\'m already doing something before my brain even knows it,\" Harris says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s something I always have done and always will do. It\\'s non-negotiable for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a boy at school who would always pick on a girl who used to be my best friend in grade four because she had a disability. I was a big kid, I was tall, so instead of saying something I would stand physically in the way but, at one point, this boy was relentless so I took him down and, apparently, I pushed him to the ground and held him down and then I found myself in the Principal\\'s office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dad remembers the Principal saying, \\'Tayla can\\'t be doing those things because that will hurt the boy\\'s self-esteem.\\' Dad went off his head. My dad still tells that story, about how wrong that particular incident was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch spirit helped Harris -- who played Aussie Rules with boys until she was told to stop aged 14 -- rise to an elite athlete in two sports. She is unbeaten in seven professional fight and holds the Australian middleweight crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet like most women in sport, Harris has had to develop a thick skin. She was accustomed to online abuse long before a picture of that kick was posted online.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer decision to join the Blues from the Brisbane Lions in 2018 stoked keyboard rage but a \"lightbulb moment\" after a conversation with a close friend helped her ride it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He said \\'why do you care what someone who you\\'ve never met and will probably never meet and have never done anything for you in your life think\\' so, from that moment, I was like \\'why do I care what that weird scummy guy is saying\\',\" says Harris, conceding that putting up with trolls is likely her lot in life, for the immediate future at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris has tweeted that she\\'d give up her AFLW wage to employ a person to monitor online abuse and has called on governing body the AFL to block people who make discriminatory comments from its social media accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking before the death of English television presenter Caroline Flack , which led to the #BeKind hashtag being used on social media, Harris adds: \"It\\'s a pretty messed up online world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a generational issue. It\\'ll be weeded out in a while when young people come through with the understanding that it\\'s not acceptable to be doing these things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris (R) fights againt Janay Harding on November 22, 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer parents, Harris admits, struggle to stoically react to the abuse she continues to receive online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They live a plane trip away so (last year) was hard, especially for mum, especially when it was all unfolding as all she wanted to do was get on the plane and make sure I was alright,\" Harris says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And all dad wanted to do was go and pay a visit to the people who were making these comments and I guess the rest is best left unsaid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before that kick was immortalized in bronze in Melbourne\\'s bustling Federation Square, Harris warned her mum not to go online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said to her \\'please don\\'t read the comments that are going to be online\\' because I knew people wouldn\\'t take the time to consider that this statue is about much more than just me,\" Harris says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Particular people who didn\\'t take the time to understand what the statue meant were hellbent on saying I didn\\'t deserve this statue. I know I don\\'t deserve a statue as a footballer, but this scenario deserves a statue for a pivotal moment in time that has helped people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris will forever be known for that photograph, but though only 22 she is not burdened by the responsibility that comes with influence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I often get young people who have experienced bullying online messaging me and they\\'ve said specifically that I\\'ve been the one who\\'s helped them actually call it out, or help their friends call it out,\" she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bullying online is so bad that young people are committing suicide, which is horrific, so if I can give someone confidence to feel a little bit better about themselves, I will do everything to do that because you just don\\'t know what could\\'ve happened otherwise.\"',\n",

       " 'The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April, although it is being held in November in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It\\'s a spring rite, steeped in tradition and layered in rich sporting history and drama. It\\'s an event that attracts even non-golfers because of the sublime beauty of the course. Click through the gallery for an A-Z of the Masters. Harry How/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revered course has hosted the year\\'s opening major -- and the only one of the big four events to be played at the same course every year -- since 1934. A is also for the azaleas which traditionally blossom during Masters week and for Amen Corner, the infamous stretch of holes incorporating the 11th, the treacherous short 12th and the tee shot on the par-five 13th. TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Georgian greensward is an oasis among the urban landscape of Augusta, Georgia\\'s second city on the banks of the Savannah River. The bars, burger joints and shopping malls of neighboring Washington Road are in stark contrast to the golfing dreamscape over the fence. B is also for Seve Ballesteros, the Spaniard who opened the European floodgates with wins in 1980 and 1983. David Cannon/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAugusta\\'s caddies are instantly recognizable by their white jump suits. Before 1983, players had to use a club caddie, all of whom were local black men. Since then players have used their usual tour caddies, but they must still don the white suit and green cap. David Cannon/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hallowed property is governed by its own strict rules such as no running or cell phones, but on the flip side traditions exist such as the practice of placing your green Masters chair at your preferred spot and being able to return to your vacant seat hours later.

The Northern Irishman blew a four-shot lead at Augusta in 2011, but having won four majors in the meantime returns for his fifth shot at the Grand Slam this week. Only five others have achieved the feat -- Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. G is also for greens -- the slick, sloping putting surfaces are infamous. Jamie Squire/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nAugusta National was created by Scottish golf course architect Dr. Alister Mackenzie and co-founder Bobby Jones and opened in 1933 on land that was once the site of Fruitlands Nursery.

The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. Patrick Smith/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saying goes the Masters doesn\\'t begin until the back nine on Sunday. It starts with one of the hardest holes on the course in the 10th and then enters Amen Corner with the equally tough 11th and then the booby trap of the short 12th. But the long 15th (pictured) is key -- big moves can be made with eagles here. Anything less than a birdie and you will likely go backwards.

I\\'ll rise unafraid!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAndra Day\\'s Grammy-nominated 2016 hit \\'Rise Up\\' has been featured in television shows and commercials -- it was played on the campaign trail by Hillary Clinton and performed at the inauguration of President Joe Biden -- but in a Tampa hotel room in February, the song had an audience of just one.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah Thomas had deliberately loaded it onto her playlist and she became emotional. \"You\\'re broken down and tired of living life on a merry-go-round,\" Day sings, \"But I promise we\\'ll take the world to its feet and move mountains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It just impacted me so strongly that morning,\" the 47-year-old told CNN . \"Every word of that song has meaning to my journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour later, Thomas left the hotel and went to the Super Bowl. That night, she was sharing the stage with Tom Brady, the Lombardi Trophy and over 100 million people watching worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd another glass ceiling had been shattered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas had been playing basketball before a decision altered the entire trajectory of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Go out for the boys team\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was growing up in Mississippi in the 1970s and 80s, Thomas says it never occurred to her that there was any such thing as \\'a glass ceiling,\\' that there were unseen barriers which would stymie the ambition of women or minorities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought of my gender, that I couldn\\'t do something because I was a girl or what I looked like,\" she said. \"My dad always told me not to depend on anybody for anything and that I could do whatever I set my mind to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas described herself as a tomboy, always hanging out with her older and younger brothers, playing football, baseball and riding dirt bikes. While her early career goals were to get into the legal profession, she was never very far from sport -- it was in her blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas\\' aunt was the basketball coach Jill Upton, who led the American women\\'s team to Moscow and a silver medal at the World University Games in 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sarah was in fifth grade at school, Upton asked her niece if she was interested in playing basketball herself. \"I said \\'I don\\'t have a girls\\' team.\\' She said, \\'Go out for the boys\\' team.\\' And I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas says she became the first girl to play in the Pascagoula City League, playing through middle and high school. That led to a scholarship at the University of Mobile in Alabama, where she remains one of the top five players in the history of the school.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I absolutely love playing basketball. I love sports, as you can well imagine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up Thomas never thought that she couldn\\'t do something because she was a girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon graduation, Thomas pursued a career in law and subsequently moved into pharmaceutical sales, but basketball was never far away. That was, until the day it was cruelly snatched away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas had been playing in a church league for three years when a decision was made that altered the entire trajectory of her life. \"The guy came up to me and he said, \\'I\\'m sorry about what happened last night.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas was 23 years old, single, and had been home alone the previous evening; she had no idea what he was talking about. \"And he goes \\'You really don\\'t know, do you? They kicked you out of the league last night. Because you\\'re a girl.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe soon learned that another player had raised an objection to competing against a female, a vote had been taken, the vote was a tie and the preacher had cut her from the league.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Thomas, the objecting player had said, \"When she posts us up or I post her up, it just feels funny.\" She had little sympathy for his argument, putting words around a situation that nobody else had the courage to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said, as fast pace of a game as basketball is, if you get some type of sexual sensation out of it, you don\\'t need to be in this game.\" She realized that by deploying such graphic imagery, she\\'d helped to seal her own fate, \"You can just imagine, in the Baptist Church, and I said, \\'sexual sensation.\\' I was too history anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got in my car, I called my dad and I was crying. I was so mad,\" Thomas remembers. \"I was like, \\'You have to be kidding me. I\\'ve played sports my entire life and because I\\'m a girl, I can\\'t play.\\' For the first time in my life, I was sports-less.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Belichick, coach of the New England Patriots, and Sarah Thomas exchange words on the sidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'They treated me like an official, not a female official\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas can\\'t remember the first time she watched a Super Bowl; football was just such an intrinsic part of her life from a very early age. When CNN asked what she would have said if somebody had told her back then that she could be a part of it one day, she enthusiastically declared, \"Sign me up!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs fate would have it, the closing of one door led to the opening of another. Sarah\\'s brother was going to a football official\\'s meeting and she asked if she could tag along. \"I guess so,\" he said. \"Be there at 6. Don\\'t be late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so, I walked into that room full of men and the gentlemen at the front just looked and watched. To break the ice, I said, \\'Is this where you become a football referee?\\' I can\\'t repeat what he said, but he [basically] said, \\'I guess so.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that moment, the life arc of Sarah Thomas was launched on a totally different trajectory, one that would challenge stereotypes and shatter norms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They treated me like an official, not a female official, but an official. And if they had not shown me the ropes at that young age, I would not be where I am today.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas worked her first varsity high school game in 1999 and by 2006, she was appearing on the NFL\\'s radar. She was invited to an official\\'s camp by Conference USA\\'s official\\'s coordinator Gerry Austin, \"Thank goodness he did,\" Thomas mused. \"It changed the course of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL Super Bowl 55.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe impressed at the camp, and in 2007, she made history by becoming the first female official in a major college football game.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took her a while to realize that she was making history, though. \"I was taken aback. When I started, I did not know that there weren\\'t any women because there were women officials officiating my basketball games.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Thomas progressed in her career, more history was made; she became the first female to referee in a Big Ten stadium -- as a line judge for Northwestern University against Rice University in \\'07.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, she became the first permanent female official in the NFL, making her league debut that September between the Houston Texans and the Kansas City Chiefs in Houston. A year later, she showed her mettle when she was injured in a collision during the Vikings-Packers game but returned to finish up with a broken wrist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019, she was the first woman to wear the zebra stripes in a playoff game, and in 2021, having successfully managed to avoid contracting Covid-19, Thomas finally made it to the Super Bowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NFL\\'s Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Troy Vincent, Sr., celebrated her achievement, saying, \"Her elite performance and commitment to excellence has earned her the right to officiate the Super Bowl. Congratulations on this well-deserved honor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following week, Thomas was still buzzing at the memory of it. \"It was remarkable,\" she told CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The one great thing about being an official is the guys that I get to be around are so professional and they are just an elite group. There was such a peace and calm; that crew was amazing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving scaled the mountain as an NFL official, she\\'ll be ready to go again next season.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a novelty, but the norm\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few referees or officials want to be the center of attention -- typically, the fans will only know your name if you\\'ve made a bad call and ended up in the news -- and Thomas was no different. She was just hoping to stay under the radar throughout the course of her career.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the second game of her second season in the NFL, she realized that her mere presence on the sideline was changing the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A coach comes up to me and said, \\'I just want to thank you for what you\\'re doing.\\'\" He went on to explain that the impact she\\'d been making was seismic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He said \\'I\\'ve coached in this league for a long time and I have two daughters, and they think they know more about football now because of you, not because I\\'m their dad and the coach.\\' That\\'s when it hit me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuper Bowl LV was also groundbreaking because, for the first time ever, two of the winning coaches were female. The Bucs\\' defensive line assistant Lori Locust and the strength and conditioning coach Maral Javadifar advanced the metaphorical ball from 2020, when the 49ers\\' Katie Sowers had become the first woman to coach in the Super Bowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this context, it\\'s perhaps merely a footnote that Tom Brady won his seventh Lombardi Trophy -- more than even the most successful franchises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas says she found Locust before the game and Javadifar afterwards, hugging and thanking each other for what they have achieved. Thomas told Javadifar that, hopefully soon, such trailblazing won\\'t be a novelty -- it will be the norm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the impact of their progress goes way beyond football and sport. The sight of three successful women sharing the spotlight with the top male athletes, in the biggest game of the year, is inspirational to girls and women everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas says it\\'s just as important, though, for young men to recognize those achievements and strive for equality in society. The moral of her 25-year journey is relevant to her daughter, naturally, but also her two sons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want them to respect their spouse, their partner, girlfriend. She\\'s an equal with you. You respect her. She\\'s out there working just as hard as you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, her sons have the utmost respect for their mom, with one texting Thomas after the game to declare her \\'the GOAT\\' (greatest of all time).\\r\\n\\r\\nTampa Bay Buc\\'s strength and conditioning coach Maral Javadifar at Super Bowl 55.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'We\\'ll rise up, a thousand times\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah Thomas knows that her life journey hasn\\'t always been straightforward or the most pleasant at times, but she wouldn\\'t change one bit of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked what she\\'d say now to the preacher who cut her from the men\\'s basketball league, Sarah explains she still sees him occasionally. \"Every time I see the preacher,\" she laughs, \"I hug his neck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no ill will towards anyone like that. God closes the door, but then he\\'ll open up three of them for you. I would say, \\'Thank you.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving scaled the mountain as an NFL official, she\\'ll be ready to go again next season and compete to be the best in her position. A new chapter begins in March, after a spot of rest and relaxation \"somewhere warm and tropical.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when she does, Andra Day could well be providing the soundtrack again: \"We\\'ll rise up in spite of the ache; we\\'ll rise up, and we\\'ll do it a thousand times again. For you.\"',\n",
       " '(CNN) Few people will envy the man elected to be the new president of FC Barcelona .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upcoming election -- to be held on Sunday, just days after four senior officials were arrested -- is arguably the most important in the club\\'s history and comes at a time of crisis that appears to be deepening by the day\\r\\n\\r\\nHistoric debts, reported by Spanish newspaper El Mundo to be more than one billion dollars, forced Barcelona into a fire sale of some of the most important figures in its playing squad during the summer transfer window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rebuilding of its decimated squad, proven once again in the recent 4-1 hammering against Paris Saint-Germain to be well below the standard of its European rivals, is one of just many headaches facing the incoming president.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of the list, however, is the future of club talisman Lionel Messi. The Argentine made public his desire to leave Barcelona last summer and it looks increasingly unlikely he will sign a new contract, meaning the greatest player in the club\\'s history can walk away for free at the end of the current season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many, many, many millions of debt for Barcelona, the worst financial situation in history,\" Catalunya Radio journalist Ernest MaciÃ\\xa0 tells CNN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the pitch, we can discuss it, but it seems evident that when the Champions League arrives, Barcelona again commits a public suicide in front of millions of people, receiving so many goals and making it so difficult even for players like Messi who love the club and probably would like to stay at Barcelona in different circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At this point it\\'s not easy to see Messi here next year, although there are many, many different variables intervening in this equation. So we will see what happens in the end because elections will take place this weekend and this is another variable in this equation, who becomes president.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLionel Messi trudges off after Barcelona\\'s recent hammering at the hands of PSG.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in February, Barcelona issued a statement to say it \"categorically\" denied responsibility for the publication of Messi\\'s $672 million contract in El Mundo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contract would make Messi the highest paid athlete in sports history and the club said it would take legal action against the newspaper \"for any damage that may be caused as a result of this publication.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leak only served to increase tensions between Messi and the Barcelona hierarchy, which had already been stretched to breaking point after the Argentine aimed a thinly veiled dig at the board in an emotional farewell to former teammate Luis Suarez.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarcelona\\'s financial problems have been exacerbated by the club\\'s move away from promoting players from its famed La Masia academy -- which has developed the likes of Messi, Pep Guardiola, Andres Iniesta and Xavi -- to the first team, instead choosing to spend vast transfer fees and wages on already established stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarcelona has reportedly spent more than $1 billion on transfer fees since the 2013/14 season and many believe this change is philosophy has eroded the club\\'s \\'More than a Club\\' mantra, which is still painted into the seats of its historic Camp Nou stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistoric elections\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with Messi, Barcelona\\'s future looks bleak; without him, however, things start to look dire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is on exactly that premise that one of the presidential candidates is hanging his hat. Joan Laporta, one of three men standing, is the current favorite to win the election and was previously president from 2003 until 2010, presiding over one of the most successful era in the club\\'s history.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his previous reign, Barcelona won 13 major trophies, including four La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues and he will be hoping that nostalgia and banked goodwill is crucial to securing another term.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Joan Laporta is, let\\'s say, closer to Leo Messi and the players because they lived together the best moments in their stories and their lives,\" MaciÃ\\xa0 says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"According to the polls now, Joan Laporta is first. There have been debates and anything can happen because a lot of people have voted via mail and it remains to be seen what influence these votes, for the first time in history, will have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJoan Laporta (R) hired Pep Guardiola to be Barcelona new head coach in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other candidates are Victor Font and Toni Freixa, who may \"split the votes,\" Macia says, something that would ultimately benefit Laporta.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucially, Font has received the backing of former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol and has predicated some of his presidential campaign on the idea of club legend Xavi returning to become the new head coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreixa, conversely, has given his backing to current head coach Ronald Koeman to continue the job he was given only last summer, but has also outlined a long-term plan that would see Xavi initially take over the Barcelona B team.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe election will be decided by votes from more than 111,000 club members -- or \\'socis\\' in Catalan -- most of who are fans of Barcelona. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, 22,811 members have asked to vote via mail, while the remaining 87,479 will vote in person at one of six stations located in the cities of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, Tarragona, Tortosa and Andorra.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacia believes this Sunday\\'s results are the most consequential in the club\\'s history.

The enforced lockdown due to the pandemic brought football to a halt around the world and slashed clubs\\' income through ticket sales and television rights deals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarcelona was particularly badly affected. The club\\'s wage bill is the highest in world football, according to a report published by UEFA earlier this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Global Sports Salaries Survey by Sporting Intelligence puts Barcelona\\'s average annual salary spend per player at $12.3m for the 2019-20 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Barcelona\\'s last accounts, up to June 30, 2019, the wage bill for all their sporting teams, which includes basketball, handball among other teams, was 671 million euros ($792 million), with the vast majority going to the football club\\'s first team.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat year, the club\\'s turnover was 990 million euros ($1.16bn) and projected to increase the following year. However, with money no longer coming in through gate receipts, TV deals and museum tickets, first team players and staff had their wages reduced by 70% in March to \"minimize the economic impact\" caused by coronavirus.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarcelona, of course, was not the only major European club to enforce a salary reduction, but it laid bare the precariousness of its current finances.\\r\\n\\r\\nBig-money transfers\\r\\n\\r\\nThese problems have been exacerbated by the club\\'s move away from promoting La Masia players to the first team -- an academy which has developed a host of stars, notably Messi, Guardiola, Andres Iniesta and Xavi -- instead choosing to spend vast transfer fees and wages on already established stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world record $263 million sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 temporarily plugged the financial gap, but the club immediately spent the money trying to find an adequate replacement for the Brazilian, often paying big on desired players.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround $170 million was paid to Liverpool for Brazilian forward Philippe Coutinho, whose unproductive time at the club came to end with a loan move to Bayern Munich after less than two years in Barcelona.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother $120 million -- plus $45 million in potential add-ons -- was reportedly spent on the largely unproven Ouseman Dembele from Borussia Dortmund. The Frenchman has shown flashes of his potential, but his three years at Barcelona so far have been defined by several long-term injuries that have limited him to just 74 appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost recently came the $135 million signing of Antoine Griezmann , who has so far failed to replicate anything close to the form he showed while at La Liga rival Atletico Madrid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAntoine Griezmann has failed to live up to his previous performances since signing for Barcelona.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch are its current financial woes, the club sold promising young midfielder Arthur to Juventus in exchange for the 30-year-old Miralem Pjanic\\r\\n\\r\\nThese signings, and many others, have not only negatively impacted the team, the results and its finances, but also the very fiber of what it means to be FC Barcelona.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There have been problems with how they basically run the club, as far as money is concerned,\" MaciÃ\\xa0 says. \"Bringing in players with high prices, players that didn\\'t work. They did buy some good players, like Frenkie de Jong, for example, a young and talented player, but ... he needs to adapt to our philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if there\\'s not anyone who ignites this philosophy, it\\'s difficult. If there\\'s not a leader that tells the new players how we play at Barcelona, it\\'s difficult because the only priority is to win the next game. And if this is the only priority, you will never win that title.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"[We cannot] play like an ordinary team. Other teams are better at playing ordinary [football], like Milan or Inter, they do not need to play beautifully and with a style, they have good players and they are good at it. While in Barcelona, they need to do something more than just win titles ... and it still won\\'t be enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So Barcelona will need a reconstruction and, I\\'m afraid, they wouldn\\'t have enough money to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They wanted to refurbish the Camp Nou and the project has been stopped. They also had to build a new [arena] for basketball and other professional sports at the club, and this project has been stopped as well. There\\'s no money for these projects.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Soul of the club lost\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 2012, the season after Guardiola left the club, his replacement Tito Vilanova famously fielded an entire 11 of players who had graduated from La Masia. Barcelona beat Levante 4-0 that day and it was an occasion heralded around Europe, as the academy was put on a pedestal as the gold standard for other clubs to aspire to.\\r\\n\\r\\nMessi, Busquets, Pique and Jordi Alba still remain from that side, but La Masia\\'s production line has since slowed. In the subsequent eight years, only Sergi Roberto has graduated to become a first-team regular.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From 2004-2010 there was a policy for years of bring players from La Masia to the first team,\" MaciÃ\\xa0 says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When Guardiola was the coach, everything was easier for these young, talented players growing up in La Masia. But then Guardiola went and the coaches that came here were basically focused on trying to win and the current board didn\\'t force them to try and raise players born in La Masia, so the soul of the club has been progressively lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s gone from \\'More than a Club,\\' which is the motto that is still in the stands, to more of a simple club in which you can see a good football team, but one that is losing its identity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the board\\'s decision to focus on big-money signings, instead of nurturing its own talent, could be the root cause, as MaciÃ\\xa0 also noted, Barcelona is also no longer able to hold onto La Masia\\'s most promising stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nCesc Fabregas\\' move to Arsenal in 2003 as a 16-year-old is perhaps the most famous example of this, but it\\'s a trend that has continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester City defender Eric Garcia, Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Xavi Simons and Manchester United-bound Marc Jurado are just three of La Masia\\'s most gifted youngsters to have left for pastures new.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscovering the next Xavi\\r\\n\\r\\nBut perhaps it\\'s unfair to compare La Masia\\'s current production line to that of Messi, Xavi and co, arguably the greatest group of players any academy has produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the success of those graduates -- Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Busquets, Pique, Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes all started the triumphant 2009 Champions League final -- every new prospect is burdened with the expectation of having to be the \"next Xavi\" or the \"next Iniesta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s about generations, you cannot expect every single year or every five years to see four players in the starting XI that just came from La Masia. It doesn\\'t really work like that,\" Fabregas tells CNN Sport. \"Iniesta is one of the best midfielders in history. Xavi, probably the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nCesc Fabregas played for Barcelona between 2011 and 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you analyze it well from the beginning, how they started and how they made it, Iniesta really started to play regularly and was considered a top player at 22. We [Arsenal] played the [2006] Champions League final against them. He came on at halftime and he changed the game and he was only 22. Iniesta started playing every single game and was considered in the undisputed starting XI at 23.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Xavi had a lot of ups and downs at Barcelona. The real Xavi that we all know and we all admire, and is probably one of the best players in the history of Barcelona, started really at 28 when Pep came into the club and said: \\'Listen, you are my man. Everything will go around you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In 2008, after the European Championship, Xavi came from two years of winning nothing at Barcelona. There were a lot of rumors; he will go, he\\'s not good enough. Then someone comes, believes in you and, all of a sudden, you\\'re a different player, a different animal and you go on for four or five years at a level that you wouldn\\'t even expect you had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that\\'s why sometimes it\\'s a bit of luck. It\\'s about having someone to trust you so much, that gives you the opportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPep Guardiola during his first pre-season as Barcelona head coach in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Messi nearing the end of his career, MaciÃ\\xa0 believes the board needs to move away from the \"win at all costs\" mentality that has prevented the club from taking risks on young talent and revert back to the philosophy of player progression that legendary Barcelona coach Johan Cruyff, who focused on how the academy teams played rather than the end result, instilled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The squad is very short, it\\'s much older and it\\'s difficult to replace players like Xavi and Iniesta,\" he explains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Messi had the best generation of homegrown players in La Masia around him, which made an impressive pack, and you had a total team with total football. Now, of course, these players are not here, it\\'s very difficult to replace them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems we have the impression that they [the board] are not trying [hard] enough to try to create a style and try to go back to the roots that Johan Cruyff started and Guardiola continued, and we are losing what we were [as a club].\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMessi vs. the board\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Messi\\'s powers remain superhuman -- he ended this season as La Liga\\'s top scorer for a record seventh time -- they are no doubt beginning to wane.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, this season he has also had to expend his energy on fighting battles off the pitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in February, Messi, a man who rarely speaks out, openly criticized Sporting Director Eric Abidal after his former teammate accused the players of downing tools to get manager Ernesto Valverde sacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nClub president Josep Bartomeu called an emergency meeting with the pair and prevented a mutiny, but Messi has since publicly aired his grievances with the club on two further occasions; once during the wage reduction negotiations and then following the recent shock defeat to Osasuna.\\r\\n\\r\\nLionel Messi has cut a visibly frustrated figure at times for Barcelona this season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Messi has been doing very well for 15 years and he was making the president better, the players better, he was making everyone around him better,\" MaciÃ\\xa0 says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because his influence is so big -- was and is so big -- he could make up for it [club\\'s lack of leadership]. But now he\\'s just starting to slow down progressively and steadily, and all the problems now appear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst Eibar in February, thousands of Barcelona fans held up white handkerchiefs in the stands -- a common way for Spanish fans to show their discontent -- as \"Bartomeu, resign\" echoed around the Camp Nou.\\r\\n\\r\\nFans were unhappy after it was alleged Bartomeu had hired a firm to attack the club\\'s own players on social media, something the president and the club denied.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile supporters may not have got their wish immediately, Bartomeu\\'s presidency will only last for one more year.\\r\\n\\r\\nFans see Barcelona\\'s 2021 presidential elections as one of the most crucial in the club\\'s history. Will it be a turning point for the club\\'s fortunes, or will the same mistakes be repeated?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, six senior members of the Barcelona board resigned and sent a strongly-worded letter to Bartomeu criticizing the management of the club and calling for the elections to be brought forward. In response to the resignations, the club said the resignations were \"due to a reorganisation of the board put forward by Bartomeu.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancesc Arnau blocks a shot by Arsenal\\'s Freddie Ljungberg during the 1999-2000 Champions League.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The [new] president cannot repeat the [current] situation,\" former Barcelona player Francesc Arnau tells CNN. \"I don\\'t know what will happen in one year, two years or three years, but a lot is changing at Barcelona; the players, the president and the structure of the organization.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We cannot know what the future holds, but for this Barcelona it\\'s impossible to repeat the titles of the [old] Barcelona and it\\'s difficult to repeat the last 10 years of Messi because of his age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If the [new] president doesn\\'t influence a lot, the change [election] isn\\'t important, but if the president can be influential then change is coming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'It\\'s not because of Leo\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nFew people would have given Napoli much of a chance against Barcelona in the Champions League before the enforced break, but these two teams have enjoyed differing fortunes since football returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Barcelona has struggled in La Liga, Napoli\\'s resurgence under new coach Gennaro Gattuso culminated in a historic Coppa Italia win over Juventus in June as the club secured its first major trophy since 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nCesc Fabregas believes Lionel Messi is still the same player as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fabregas believes any team with Messi in the side has a chance. Talk of the Argentine\\'s demise, he says, is premature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new format of ties being played over one leg instead of two also gives Barcelona a better chance of progressing, if Messi is able to produce yet another moment of magic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe that Leo had a very good season,\" Fabregas says. \"People can tell me what they want, but I watch every single match. He scored 25 goals, he made 21 assists in his worst season. If you tell me that I could do that, then I would be very, very happy, believe me, and this would be the best season of my career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People shouldn\\'t look at the results so much, they should look at the performances to see what he does and what he doesn\\'t do, and then analyze. Leo had a top season, but the problem is that maybe around him the team didn\\'t have a top season, but individually himself, I saw him as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you are winning, when you are successful it\\'s because 15, 16 players have been at the top of their game. It\\'s difficult to win Champions Leagues and league titles competing against Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid when only four, five or six players compete at the level required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s why Barcelona have struggled this season with Lionel Messi in their team and having watched it, it\\'s not because of Leo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Messi branded the team \"weak\" following that defeat to Osasuna on the penultimate day of the season, coach Quique Setien openly admitted he did not know whether he would still be in charge for the remainder of the Champions League campaign. Much is on the line this weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictory against Napoli on Saturday would mean crisis postponed, if not quite crisis averted.',\n",

Last month, Maximum Security won $10 million in the inaugural Saudi Cup\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defendants are accused of misleading and defrauding the government agency that regulates the veterinary care for racehorses by disguising the banned drugs with misleading labels.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecutors unsealed four indictments Monday that accuse 27 people -- horse trainers, veterinarians and drug distributors -- of carrying out separate but related conspiracies to covertly provide performance-enhancing drugs to racehorses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey\\'re accused of having various roles in the scheme to manufacture, distribute and administer performance-enhancing drugs to racehorses that were altered in order to not raise suspicions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These defendants engaged in this conduct not for the love of the sport, and certainly not out of concern for the horses, but for money,\" US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said in a news release. \"And it was the racehorses that paid the price for the defendants\\' greed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indictment\\'s accusations target some of the most prominent trainers and horses in the sport, such as Servis, the trainer of Maximum Security.

The indictment says Navarro provided performance-enhancing drugs to XY Jet, who died in January 2020 of an apparent heart attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe types of drugs that were given to horses were meant to \"increase their performance beyond their natural abilities,\" said William Sweeney Jr., the assistant director in charge of the FBI \\'s New York office. Drugs that were used could increase red blood cell count, increase stamina and endurance, relieve pain and reduce joint inflammation, according to the indictment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What actually happened to the horses amounted to nothing less than abuse,\" Sweeney said. \"They experienced cardiac issues, overexertion leading to leg fractures, increased risk of injury and, in some cases, death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne drug, erythropoietin, known as \"epo,\" boosts a horse\\'s red blood cell count to increase endurance and speed recovery, one of the four indictments said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne indictment calls the defendants\\' actions a \"widespread, corrupt scheme\" to secretly administer these drugs to racehorses, evade rules that prohibit them and deceive horse racing authorities and regulators in order to \"improve race performance and obtain prize money\" from races in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and the United Arab Emirates, \"all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne horse trainer is accused of working with someone else to \"quietly dispose of the bodies of dead horses,\" rather than report those horses\\' deaths to authorities, Berman said at the news conference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know how many f**king horses he (Navarro) f**king killed and broke down that I made disappear ...

       " 'Hong Kong (CNN Business) China bucked the global recession in 2020, and in doing so narrowed the economic gap with the United States. Now it says it needs to pick up the pace this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile China emerged from the global downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic on surer footing than any other major economy, it still only grew 2.3% in 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new target is more than what China needs to accomplish to get back on track with President Xi Jinping\\'s long-term goal for the economy. To reach Xi\\'s plans to double GDP by 2035, China would need to grow a bit less than 5% this year, with similar growth through the next decade or so.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it\\'s also still lower than what some observers would have liked to have seen for the world\\'s second largest economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"China unexpectedly set a GDP growth target, but at a relatively low level,\" wrote Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING. \"I am worried that the low GDP target could signal a possibility that the government includes a scenario for the comeback of Covid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLi\\'s remarks came during China\\'s \"Two Sessions\" meeting, the country\\'s biggest political gathering of the year. Beforehand, there had been an intense debate in the country about whether to bring back a GDP target, which it abandoned last year for the first time in decades as the coronavirus took hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In setting this target, we have taken into account the recovery of economic activity,\" Li said on Friday, adding that the goal would \"help sustain healthy economic growth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome experts â\\x80\\x94 including Yang Weimin, the former secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission â\\x80\\x94 have encouraged such guidance, saying that China needs to set benchmarks to keep its growth on pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut others have been wary about bringing back GDP targets just yet. Ma Jun, a policymaker at the People\\'s Bank of China, said earlier this year that goals that are too ambitious could encourage local governments to borrow too much, heightening the risk of accumulating \"hidden\" debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nA balanced recovery\\r\\n\\r\\nChina spent hundreds of billions of dollars last year on programs to stimulate economic activity, including major infrastructure projects and cash handouts for its citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat amount of spending isn\\'t carrying over to 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nLi said Friday that China has set the budget deficit for the year at about 3.2%, slightly lower than that of last year, \"in view of the effective containment of Covid-19 and gradual economic recovery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLi also lowered the amount of money local governments will be able to issue in special bonds this year by about 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) â\\x80\\x94 though it still clocks in at some 3.65 trillion yuan ($564 billion). That money is primarily used to fund infrastructure projects, such as 5G networks, airports, railways, and charging stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also said that the country would no longer issue special treasury bonds this year. The government issued about $155 billion worth of such bonds in 2020 to fund medical equipment and technology used to fight the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other countries, China has to figure out how to balance a need for at least some additional stimulus as the recovery continues with a growing debt burden.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, the rate of growth last year was still China\\'s slowest in decades. And there are some points of weakness in the economy: Retail sales have lagged, for example, suggesting that people are still wary of spending money as the country struggles to stamp out Covid-19 outbreaks entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ambitious vaccine program is part of the equation, as China tries to inoculate the 1.4 billion people who live there. So far, it\\'s only vaccinated about 3.5% of the population, though plans to reach 40% by the end of June\\r\\n\\r\\nLi reiterated that the government will maintain \"necessary support\" for the economy and \"avoid sharp turns\" in policy as it tries to balance the recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysts at Nomura said Friday that the new economic growth target could be interpreted as \"too conservative.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In our view, Beijing is acutely aware that GDP growth could exceed 8% this year,\" they wrote in a research note, adding that the government \"may be reluctant\" to set a bar that high \"because of the disparate impacts among provinces and cities from the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther challenges\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other areas for Beijing to keep an eye on this year, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this week, Guo Shuqing, the Communist Party boss at the central bank, told reporters that the country\\'s property sector might be in a bubble and added that the speculative trend is \"dangerous.\" Regulators have already issued rules meant to limit lending to the sector, and Guo\\'s comments imply there could be a further tightening of credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuo also warned that bad loans could continue to pose risks to the financial system, which could slow the pace of recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nA slew of major state-owned firms have declared bankruptcy or defaulted on loans in the past year â\\x80\\x94 a concerning trend for a sector that Xi has wanted to bolster as a major driver of economic activity and innovation. Defaults by state firms surged to $15.5 billion in 2020, up 220% from the previous year, according to recent estimates by Jinan-based Zhongtai Securities.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina has other challenges, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, Li stressed the importance of job stability, adding that the country will \"increase employment opportunities\" where it is able. Unemployment remains a big concern for Beijing, and the country has pledged to create at least 11 million new jobs in urban areas this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the country\\'s urban unemployment rate remains about 5.6%, some analysts suspect the full picture could be much higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The risk to the Chinese economy [in 2021] is a consumption slowdown,\" said Yao Yang, director of the China Center for Economic Research at China\\'s Peking University, in a video published on a Tencent-affiliated media website in December. He said that China\\'s overall unemployment rate could be near 20%, much higher than the government\\'s count of urban unemployment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country is also trying to boost its economy as it works toward other priorities, including a desire to shed its reliance on the United States for key technology â\\x80\\x94 though some of its efforts have been hampered by US restrictions on Chinese companies, such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, Li said the government will focus on innovation by spending more money on research and development.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country is trying to reduce emissions, and intends to \"strengthen comprehensive measures and joint efforts on air pollution prevention and control,\" according to Li.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecoming carbon neutral by 2060 is one of China\\'s big priorities â\\x80\\x94 a lofty goal, considering China uses more coal than the rest of the world combined.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Steven Jiang contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'Washington, DC (CNN) Jaime Waydo spent years building self-driving cars at Waymo, and was quick to praise their abilities. The cars already had the experience of 300 years of average driving experience, she said in a 2017 interview . Waymo\\'s self-driving cars could see 360 degrees, she noted, while humans could see about 120 degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"[The cars] can also see up to two football fields away, which is a significantly better vision than what you or I probably have,\" Waydo told an interviewer in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in a recent interview with CNN Business, Waydo spoke more of the challenges and limits of self-driving cars, like identifying puddles, or seeing clearly when the sun is low on the horizon. She said her years working on self-driving showed her all of the unusual things can happen on the roads, which make it difficult for even advanced artificial intelligence to react appropriately to the myriad new scenarios it might encounter. A Waymo self-driving car once saw a baby crawling on a road, she recalled. (The baby was fine, according to Waydo.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWaydo, who left her role as lead systems engineer at Waymo in 2018 to work on autonomous systems at Apple, is now joining Cavnue, a startup making digital infrastructure intended to help self-driving cars understand roads, so they can actually drive better than a human.\\r\\n\\r\\nA US Department of Transportation illustration shows how vehicle to infrastructure technology is designed to function and improve road safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoads, signs and traffic lights were designed when governments expected that only humans would drive cars. A bright green light may be the easiest way to tell a human it\\'s safe to drive ahead, but a self-driving car may be better off if the information is messaged to them over a radio or cellular network. As the task of developing and rolling out self-driving cars has started to look slower and more difficult than expected, autonomous driving executives like Waydo are increasingly warming up to the idea of retrofitting infrastructure to get them on roads faster. But critics say the technology is unproven and the costs could be expensive for governments already struggling with the cost of simple road upkeep, like filling potholes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJaime Waydo, a longtime self-driving car engineer, has joined Cavnue to develop smart technology to help autonomous vehicles drive safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaydo wants self-driving technology to spread broadly so that people like her father, whom she said lives in a rural area and has Parkinson\\'s Disease, can benefit from the technology. (Waymo, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet, operates a self-driving robotaxi service in part of Phoenix, Arizona, but hasn\\'t expanded it across the country.)\\r\\n\\r\\nShe\\'s not alone in coming around on the merits of smart infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Fleming, CEO of the self-driving truck company Torc Robotics, which Daimler owns a majority stake in, said his company expects to announce smart infrastructure partnerships this year. He\\'s been working on autonomous vehicles since competing in a 2004 government-sponsored race that\\'s widely credited with kicking off the self-driving car industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a lot of uncertainty as far as which technical solutions made the most amount of sense,\" Fleming told CNN Business. \"When we first started we really didn\\'t know. Today, I\\'m convinced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says smart infrastructure, like a traffic signal that broadcasts its color, has an advantage of being simpler than the artificial intelligence algorithms companies use to perceive things like red or green lights.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaydo recalled that when Waymo expanded to Texas, it had to adjust to traffic lights that are horizontal, requiring more work from engineers. With smart infrastructure, she said, traffic lights can all seem the same to self-driving cars, making it easier to launch the cars in new places.\\r\\n\\r\\nEryk Nice, a vice president of technology strategy at Hyundai\\'s self-driving venture Motional, is a believer that smart infrastructure can speed how fast self-driving cars arrive to the public. For example, self-driving vehicles struggle to navigate parking garages, but sensors mounted in a garage could tell the cars exactly where they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nVehicle-to infrastructure technology is an ambitious goal. Cavnue and its competitors will have to develop cost-effective sensors that are hung along roadsides and capable of communicating with nearby cars. Maintenance costs will need to be manageable. The company said it\\'s planning for the technology to be cheaper than the cost of lighting a roadway. Waydo declined to say specifically what type of sensors may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut some critics are holding their ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nKyle Vogt, the founder of Cruise, GM\\'s self-driving operation, said in 2014 that, \"if you have a job in [vehicle-to-infrastructure] right now, you should probably look for a new one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVogt described the hurdles of the technology as proving it works before installation, getting local communities to support installing it and convincing local governments to pay for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCruise spokeswoman Tiffany Testo told CNN Business that Vogt\\'s views haven\\'t changed. She pointed to the progress of self-driving cars when compared to smart infrastructure as an indication that it\\'s not needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nVogt isn\\'t alone in his concerns. Paul Godsmark, co-founder of the Canadian Automated Vehicle Centre of Excellence, recalled when the US federal government pushed for connecting cars to infrastructure via short-range radios , but the auto industry didn\\'t embrace the technology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The [Department of Transportation] had backed the wrong horse,\" Godsmark said. \"We know tech moves faster than the public sector.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler, Arizona, home to Waymo\\'s self-driving ridehail service, says it hasn\\'t installed any infrastructure especially for self-driving cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicah Miranda, Chandler\\'s economic development director, told CNN Business that currently the technology seems like an inefficient use of capital as self-driving vehicles aren\\'t being used broadly, and it\\'s unclear what infrastructure technology would be best as it isn\\'t standardized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tearing up roads, light poles, that kind of stuff, the cost of that infrastructure is very expensive,\" Miranda said.\"We have to make sure our capital dollars are going into serving the broadest portion of the population in their transportation needs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest players in self-driving â\\x80\\x94 Waymo, Cruise, and Aurora, which acquired Uber\\'s self-driving arm â\\x80\\x94 all say their vehicles don\\'t rely on smart infrastructure today. They also declined to say if they believe smart infrastructure would speed their ability to deploy self-driving cars to cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Waymo\\'s parent company Alphabet may be hedging its bets. Cavnue was founded by Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, which is funded by Alphabet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, Cavnue was selected to help alleviate congestion on a Maryland highway outside Washington DC, Interstate 270. Cavnue will work on the project with the Australian infrastructure company Transurban, which was selected by the Maryland Department of Transportation and then chose Cavnue.\\r\\n\\r\\nRob Deans, Transurban\\'s vice president of technology, said his company was impressed with Cavnue\\'s experience in connected and autonomous vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Autonomous vehicles are probably the single biggest change coming to transport,\" he told CNN Business. \"I think they have an opportunity to leverage Alphabet, the leader with their subsidiary or spinout, Waymo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWaymo is part of Cavnue\\'s advisory team on a smart road project outside Detroit. Cavnue CEO Tyler Duvall said its business model may rely on tolls for road access, or payments if a road isn\\'t congested.\\r\\n\\r\\nCavnue\\'s team is small today, with about 14 people, according to Duvall. But it plans to grow, and he said it\\'s finding significant interest, and is having conversations with about eight governments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s insatiable interest for innovation,\" he said of transportation officials. \"It\\'s can we build the team fast enough to bring the idea to them.\"',\n",

For a long time. \"Deepening partisan trench warfare will only worsen fights over the basic rules of voting,\" he wrote, \"undermining the shared legitimacy of elections on which democracy depends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I heard Fox Corp CEO Lachlan Murdoch speak at an investor conference. And he reaffirmed Drutman\\'s analysis without knowing it. How so? Because Murdoch signaled that Fox News will keep sending reinforcements down the trench for the partisan warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference on Thursday, he said \"the main beneficiary of the Trump administration from a ratings point of view was MSNBC. That\\'s because they were the loyal opposition.\" And \"that\\'s what our job is now with the Biden administration. You\\'ll see our ratings really improve,\" he predicted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe days of Fox portraying itself as a \"fair and balanced\" news network are long gone, but external perception is still catching up to the internal reality...\\r\\n\\r\\nMSNBC\\'s push-back\\r\\n\\r\\nA rep for the NBCUniversal News Group forcefully responded to Murdoch\\'s comment about MSNBC:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our role, and the role of any legitimate news organization -- whether it includes an \\'opinion section\\' or not -- is to hold power to account, regardless of party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anti-Democrat channel\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one level Lachlan was just being honest. Fox\\'s brand is anti-Democrat. It has been for a long time. But the last time a Democratic president took office, twelve years ago, Fox execs contorted into pretzels to avoid stating the obvious. Bill Shine told me back then that Fox would \"cover the news in a fair and balanced way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRead that archived NYT story to see how much has changed. Fox\\'s content is further right-wing than it was back then. And more news hours have been converted to full-fledged talk shows. That\\'s why I believe the best way to measure Fox is by its journalism. How many bureaus are being operated? How many scoops are being generated? How many reporters are being hired? How much original reporting is on the air? Sadly, all those numbers are relatively low. Murdoch is investing in opinion, not news. Fewer facts, more fights.\\r\\n\\r\\nFox\\'s audience was \"disappointed...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian Lowry writes: \"While his reference to Fox being \\'the loyal opposition\\' is understandably getting attention, it shouldn\\'t obscure another quote from Lachlan: how the Fox News audience was \\'disappointed with the election results,\\' as if Fox played no role in helping to stoke that anger or establish that frame of mind...\"',\n",

You can sign up right here\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon (CNN Business) A wave of anxiety is sweeping through stock and bond markets as investors prepare to enter a new phase of the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s happening: Concerns are growing that a strong economic recovery later this year will cause a spike in inflation. That\\'s sparked a selloff in government bonds. When prices fall, yields rise, which weighs on stocks\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a sharp bump on Friday, the S&P 500 â\\x80\\x94 which has dropped in the last three trading sessions â\\x80\\x94 will notch its third consecutive week of declines, as the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury moves back toward 1.6%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the Covid-19 vaccine allowing for economic activity to be restored, coupled with fresh injections of fiscal stimulus in the pipeline, investors are holding on to the narrative that inflation could make a roaring comeback,\" FXTM market analyst Han Tan told clients on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent days, Wall Street has become laser-focused on one big question: If significantly higher prices do materialize, will Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have the stomach for it?\\r\\n\\r\\nPowell said at an event on Thursday that he does expect inflation to rise as the economy reopens. But he emphasized that the Fed does not intend to change course as a result, since low interest rates and bond purchases will continue to be necessary to support the ongoing recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Compared to the economic scenarios we contemplated a year ago, it\\'s good to see where we are,\" Powell said. The Fed, he added, will try to differentiate between a \"one-time surge in prices and ongoing inflation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEasy monetary policies like rock-bottom interest rates have been a boon for riskier investments like stocks over the past year. Wall Street is worried the mood could change when rates start to rise again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch fears are top of mind with Friday\\'s jobs report on tap. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv expect to learn that the US economy added 182,000 jobs in February, up from 49,000 in January.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s certainly an improvement, but would still leave Americans down millions of jobs since the start of the pandemic. Such a reading may reassure Wall Street that any talk of the Fed tightening policy is premature.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestors will be particularly alert for unexpected signs of wage inflation, however. Average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen by 0.2%.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch this space: US prices don\\'t exist in a vacuum. One of the reasons inflation has been so low in recent decades has been thanks to China, which has served as a global factory for low-cost goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country said Friday that it would target economic growth of more than 6% in 2021. A strong recovery in China could help keep prices low. But there are some concerns that economic scarring from the pandemic has permanently hurt supply chains and reduced manufacturing capacity. That dynamic could contribute to inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOil prices surge after producers extend production cuts\\r\\n\\r\\nCountries are beginning to look toward life after the pandemic. But oil producers, nervous about upsetting delicate price dynamics, aren\\'t racing to put more barrels on the market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies said Thursday that they would largely roll over production cuts during the month of April, my CNN Business colleague Charles Riley reports.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo countries â\\x80\\x94 Russia and Kazakhstan â\\x80\\x94 were granted exemptions to increase their output by a small amount.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember: The OPEC+ group agreed in January to keep production steady for February and March. At that time, Saudi Arabia surprised markets by pledging to cut its production by an extra 1 million barrels per day, a move that reflected unease about fragile demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaudi Arabia agreed on Thursday to extend its extra cut through April. Including that contribution, the broader group\\'s supply cuts amount to nearly 8 million barrels per day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent months, rising prices have made producers more confident that the market is on solid footing following its pandemic crash. But for now, the group is opting to play it safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestor insight: Oil prices are jumping as a result. US oil was last trading above $65 per barrel for the first time since January 2020. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, are near $68.50.\\r\\n\\r\\nUBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo thinks US oil prices will rise to $72 per barrel later this year if the expected surge in demand for energy materializes as economies reopen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With a cautious approach from OPEC+ and limited production growth outside the group, oil inventories are likely to fall at a fast pace in April,\" Staunovo told clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat would continue to support prices. Customers could also start to pay more for gas at the pump. AAA said Thursday that the US average for a gallon of regular gasoline has increased by two cents this week to $2.74.\\r\\n\\r\\nA container shortage is hitting companies like Costco\\r\\n\\r\\nA global shortage of shipping containers triggered by the pandemic is squeezing companies around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCostco COST is the latest to sound the alarm. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told analysts after markets closed on Thursday that container shortfalls contributed to delays in delivering furniture, sporting goods, lawn and garden equipment and even some food items, including seafood, imported cheeses and oils.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We expect these pressures to ease in the coming months, but it\\'s impacting everyone, of course,\" Galanti said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s happening: According to Hillebrand, a logistics company, containers were stranded in North America and Europe at the beginning of the pandemic and couldn\\'t make their way back to Asia. There was no time to clear the backlog before more started coming in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe firm says that production of new containers remains \"woefully low,\" and prices for those on the market has skyrocketed. Hillebrand doesn\\'t expect the situation to normalize until later this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosts are being passed on to customers like Costco, which said Thursday that sales increased nearly 15% from one year ago in its most recent quarter as customers continue to stock up on food and cleaning supplies.

       " '(CNN Business) India issued strict new rules on Thursday for Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and other social media platforms weeks after the country\\'s government attempted to pressure Twitter to take down accounts it deemed incendiary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rules require any social media company to create three roles in India: a \"compliance officer\" who will ensure they follow local laws; a \"grievance officer\" who will address complaints from Indian users about their platforms; and a \"contact person\" available to Indian law enforcement 24/7. The companies will also have to publish a compliance report every month detailing how many complaints they received and what action they took.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media platforms will also be required to remove some types of content, including posts that feature \"full or partial nudity,\" a \"sexual act\" or \"impersonation including morphed images.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge social networks, which India will define soon based on the number of users, will be given three months to comply with the policy changes, while smaller ones are expected to comply immediately, the government said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new rules come on the heels of a tense standoff between Twitter and the Indian government. Twitter reinstated several accounts that the government had ordered it to take down for using what it called \"incendiary and baseless\" hashtags related to farmers protesting against new agricultural reforms. The platform ultimately took down hundreds of accounts and partially restricted others, but drew a line by refusing to block accounts of journalists, activists and politicians.',\n",
       " '(CNN Business) India\\'s efforts to crack down on dissent have left Twitter with an impossible balancing act: protecting free speech, or risking its employees and business in one of the company\\'s most vital markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company said in a blog post Wednesday that it was \"served with several separate blocking orders\" by the Indian government against hundreds of Twitter accounts in the past 10 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly last week, it briefly suspended many of those accounts at the government\\'s behest but reinstated them a few hours later after a public outcry, including one handle with over 200,000 followers supporting the ongoing protests by farmers against new agricultural reforms and another belonging to one of the country\\'s most prominent magazines.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwitter said it restored the accounts \"in a manner that we believe was consistent with Indian law,\" but was hit with a non-compliance notice by India\\'s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The notice threatened Twitter\\'s employees with up to seven years in jail, according to a report from BuzzFeed News.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement Wednesday night local time, the Indian government said it had asked Twitter to remove tweets and accounts using hashtags that contained the phrase \"farmer genocide,\" as well as accounts it said were supported by separatist sympathizers and backed by India\\'s neighbor and rival Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In India, we value freedom and we value criticism because it is part of our democracy,\" the government said. \"But freedom of expression is not absolute and it is subject to reasonable restrictions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government added that Twitter \"is welcome to do business in India\" but must respect local laws, and criticized \"the manner in which Twitter has unwillingly, grudgingly and with great delay complied with the substantial parts of the order.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social media company said it had taken some action against more than 500 accounts that were flagged by the government\\'s orders. Twitter said they were in \"clear violation of its rules.\" It also made several other accounts only visible outside India and restricted the visibility of certain hashtags containing harmful content.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Twitter also drew a line in the sand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because we do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law, and, in keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression, we have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians,\" the company said. \"We will continue to maintain dialogue with the Indian government and respectfully engage with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWho will blink first?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith more than 700 million internet users, India is a huge and important market for global tech companies, albeit an increasingly precarious one as the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to tighten its grip on the internet and social media.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Twitter is the latest company to find itself in the government\\'s crosshairs. The platform has become a key conduit for the public â\\x80\\x94 and increasingly international â\\x80\\x94 debate between proponents and critics of the Indian government\\'s farm laws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The shrinking space for civil society is being mirrored by censorship and anti-democratic regulatory moves to censor users from their rights to free speech,\" said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director at advocacy group Equality Labs. \"It is time for the world to understand how much is at risk right now and for American companies like Twitter and Facebook to act before it\\'s too late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwitter, for now, appears to be standing its ground against the Indian government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will continue to advocate for the right of free expression on behalf of the people we serve. We are exploring options under Indian law â\\x80\\x94 both for Twitter and for the accounts that have been impacted,\" the company said Wednesday. \"We remain committed to safeguarding the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, and strongly believe that the tweets should flow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the government chooses to make good on its threats or further escalate the situation, Twitter is left with few good options.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are two main risks: The first is to Twitter\\'s employees in India, who may be at risk if the company fails to comply with demands,\" said Jillian York, Director of Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The second risk is that Twitter continues to refuse and gets blocked in India. While this may be the right moral outcome, it\\'s obviously not the best outcome for the Indian people, many of whom rely on social media to get out key messages about what\\'s happening on the ground,\" she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man reads tweets by Indian celebrities, one of the many backing the Indian government, on his mobile in New Delhi, India, on Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThreading the needle\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Twitter and the Indian government remain at an impasse with each other, both sides must also deal with external scrutiny.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media companies have long faced pressure to do more to combat misinformation and hate speech on their platforms. And those issues, hotly debated in the United States, often have further reaching and more sinister consequences in countries where the companies have a smaller business footprint but a far larger impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwitter has been more proactive about policing its platform in recent months, taking down thousands of accounts linked to the conspiracy theory QAnon and banning one of its most prolific and controversial users â\\x80\\x94 former US President Donald Trump. With that ban, Twitter showed a willingness to apply its policies to a world leader who violated them, albeit towards the end of his time in office. Its standoff in India also pits it against a powerful world leader in an important market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jack has shown in the past that he can lead with his values,\" said Soundararajan, referring to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut India, with more than three times the population of the United States and a very different social and political context, presents one of the trickiest challenges to Twitter outside its home country. In another apparent setback, the company also confirmed this week that its public policy head for India, Mahima Kaul, will step down in April after more than five years. (Twitter does not break down user data for India, but third-party research suggests the country is one of its larger markets.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fundamental problem is consistency ... are they able to do the same kind of contextual analysis that they did around QAnon posts, hydroxychloroquine posts and Trump\\'s incitement?\" said David Kaye, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine who previously served as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. \"India is a really great example of how hard that is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia, which bills itself as the world\\'s largest democracy, must also calibrate its response. Even as it battles with Twitter, the Modi government is fighting a perception battle with some of Twitter\\'s most prominent voices â\\x80\\x94 the country\\'s foreign ministry recently released a statement slamming \"sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others,\" after tweets about the farmer protests by singer Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg went viral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think there\\'s still a risk for Modi in particular of appearing to be unable to handle sort of fundamental democratic principles like the right to peaceful assembly, the right to protest, the right to criticize and so forth,\" Kaye said. \"I think it\\'ll be interesting to see if the Biden administration and other governments, who are friendly with India but are in the democratic camp, really encourage the government to take a different approach here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n-- CNN\\'s Manveena Suri and Esha Mitra contributed to this report.',\n",

While the website is still live, none of its services work anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was heartbroken when I found out,\" Liang told CNN Business. \"I feel like there is one place fewer in China through which we can expand our horizons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice in Shanghai arrested 14 people they claim ran the website and app after a three-month investigation into suspected intellectual property infringement. At the time of its closure, Renren Yingshi had amassed over eight million registered users and was home to more than 20,000 pirated TV shows and movies. The site\\'s operators made some 16 million yuan ($2.5 million) in the past couple of years from ads, subscription fees, and selling hard drives loaded with pirated content, according to police.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenren Yingshi did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crackdown was lauded by state media and intellectual property experts as a sign of China\\'s resolve to enforce copyright protection â\\x80\\x94 criticism over which has dogged Beijing for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it also drew a wave of backlash from fans who, like Liang, had long relied on the site for uncensored foreign content.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenren Yingshi, also known as YYeTs.com, was one of China\\'s largest and longest-running destinations for pirated foreign TV shows and movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn outpouring of support for Renren Yingshi dominated China\\'s Twitter-like Weibo platform in the days after the crackdown. Some thanked the site for \"opening a door for us to the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public outcry came, at least in part, because of how tightly the Chinese government restricts access to foreign content. It is one of only four countries or regions, alongside North Korea, Syria and Crimea, that doesn\\'t allow access to Netflix, the world\\'s most-popular streaming platform, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina also strictly limits how many foreign films can be screened in cinemas each year. And of the content that is allowed to air in the country, much is heavily censored\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Chinese millennials, watching foreign shows and movies is not only a favorite pastime â\\x80\\x94 it\\'s an opportunity to learn about the world. And many of them say the roadblocks imposed by the Chinese government leave them with little choice but to turn to pirated websites, even though they are willing to pay for legitimate access to uncensored, foreign content.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the demise of Renren Yingshi and the country\\'s censorship crackdown suggests the status quo might not change, the reaction to its closure and the popularity of uncensored work shows that there remains a huge appetite for such content within China.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrict censorship rules\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 2003 by a group of Chinese students in Canada, Renren Yingshi â\\x80\\x94 a phrase that means \"everyone\\'s film and TV\" â\\x80\\x94 was born out of a desire to spread foreign TV shows and movies more widely within China.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung, internet-savvy Chinese were drawn to foreign content as China reformed its economy and opened up to the world. They found that such films and shows offered an edgier, more diverse alternative to the heavily censored content produced at home â\\x80\\x94 as well as a way to learn about other cultures and societies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting access to that kind of content through legitimate means, though, is difficult in China.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the early 1990s, authorities have allowed just a few dozen foreign films to be screened in the country each year â\\x80\\x94 only nine of the 26 Oscar best picture winners were screened publicly in China from 1994 to 2019, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, have also been unable to crack the market. Netflix, for example, told shareholders in 2016 that the \"regulatory environment for foreign digital content services\" was \"challenging\" in China. A subsequent attempt to partner with a local company to distribute content failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe content that is allowed to air in China, meanwhile, needs to meet strict guidelines. Movies or shows with controversial themes â\\x80\\x94 such as those that depict China in a bad light, portray taboo subjects like the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, or feature LGBTQ storylines â\\x80\\x94 are kept out entirely. And since China lacks a film rating system, any content approved by Chinese regulators is heavily edited to remove certain scenes, such as graphic sex or violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Oscar-winning Freddie Mercury biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was released in China in 2019, for example, any mention of the Queen singer\\'s sexuality â\\x80\\x94 as well as his AIDS diagnosis â\\x80\\x94 was edited out\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Game of Thrones\" is heavily censored in China due to its graphic sex and violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the American blockbuster fantasy drama \"Game of Thrones,\" which built its popularity on graphic sex and violence, was censored so heavily on Chinese streaming giant Tencent Video that some viewers complained that it was turned into a staid \"medieval European castle documentary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were too many \\'sensitive\\' scenes deleted that I could hardly understand the plot anymore -- it was so confusing,\" said a fan of the show who watched on Tencent Video. The fan asked to remain anonymous because she once helped translate shows for a website that featured pirated content, and she also spoke to CNN Business about that experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s little indication that these rules may change. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, tolerance for foreign ideas and values has declined drastically. Popular Western culture is seen by Beijing as a key risk for foreign infiltration that targets Chinese youth â\\x80\\x94 making such content important for the government to control.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long history of legal issues\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sweeping restrictions have motivated fans of shows and movies that run afoul of censorship rules to subtitle them in Chinese and upload unauthorized copies online. They operate in loose networks of volunteer translators known as fansub groups\\r\\n\\r\\nRenren Yingshi was among the largest of these networks, exploding in popularity as American series like \"Prison Break,\" \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"Gossip Girl\" became smash hits in China.\\r\\n\\r\\none of more than 100 Chinese websites for \"rectification\" after the government issued Long before the latest crackdown, Renren Yingshi was running into trouble with authorities.

The strategy won the blessing of Chinese state media, which At the time, Renren Yingshi vowed to give upits video downloading service, and in 2010pivoted to translating open online courses offered by American universities. The strategy won the blessing of Chinese state media, which heralded the website as \"a knowledge evangelist in the internet age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat love-in didn\\'t last. The website eventually resumed offering pirated shows, and its servers were shut down by Chinese regulators in 2014, not long after the Motion Picture Association of America included Renren Yingshi on a list of pirate sites . It eventually popped back up, and at one point even moved its servers to South Korea for a time as it continued to look for ways to stay operational.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, Renren Yingshi\\'s interest in making money might have led to its downfall. While it began as a volunteer endeavor, Renren Yingshi eventually started accepting advertisements on videos, and charged members to view its content.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"According to Chinese law, if copyright infringement was conducted for the purpose of making a profit, it is very easy to constitute a crime,\" said Xu Xinming, an intellectual property lawyer at Beijing Mingtai Law Firm.\\r\\n\\r\\nXu noted that in China, a business needs to make just a few thousand dollars in order to run afoul of copyright crime laws â\\x80\\x94 well short of the millions police claim Renren Yingshi raked in.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not surprising, Xu says, that Beijing would want to go so hard against a platform with such a high profile. The government has worked harder over the last decade to address infringement, especially given Western accusations that copyright abuse runs rampant in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2020 alone, Chinese authorities shut down more than 2,800 websites and apps offering pirated content and deleted 3.2 million links, according to the most recent data available from the National Copyright Administration of China.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Using my love to generate power\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not clear when the case may be resolved, though copyright infringement results in a punishment of up to seven years in prison, depending on the severity of the violation. Police in Shanghai did not respond to a request from CNN Business for more information on the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter what happens to Renren Yingshi, though, it leaves behind a vast legacy of cultural exchange.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many friends around me have grown up watching American series. They gave us a lot of extra parameters in our way of thinking,\" said Lin, the Game of Thrones fan. She said she volunteered for a fansub group in high school called \"Garden of Eden.\" \"If you\\'ve had so much exposure to different cultures, races and people from different backgrounds since a young age ... it is easier for you to be able to see things from another perspective.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said she was \"using my love to generate power\" â\\x80\\x94 a phrase commonly cited by volunteers who want to emphasize that they are motivated by their passion for the shows, and not money.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe translation work wasn\\'t easy, Lin said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every Friday, when the latest episode came out, the timer was on,\" said Lin, who translated episodes of the American supernatural teen drama \"The Vampire Diaries,\" as well as sitcoms \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"Two Broke Girls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two Broke Girls,\" starring Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs, is a popular show among Chinese millennials.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone in the United States or Canada would record the show and send it along with English subtitles. Teams would then divide the episode into 10-minute segments and assign them to translators.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a lot of stuff I needed to look up,\" said Lin, adding that it took her about two hours to translate 10 minutes of video. \"Sometimes the characters would tell a joke that I couldn\\'t get, and I had to search for it online.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was difficult because I had to use [Chinese search engine] Baidu within the Great Firewall,\" she said, referring to the government\\'s sprawling internet censorship apparatus.\\r\\n\\r\\ntranslation of Buddhist texts in ancient China, the translation of Western literature and social science works during the late Qing dynasty, and the translation of modern works on humanities and social sciences after the Cultural Revolution. The work of fansub volunteers has effectively acted as a fourth wave of \"translation activity that has had a huge impact on Chinese culture,\" wrote Yan Feng, a professor of Chinese language and literature at Fudan University in Shanghai, in a widely shared Weibo post on February 3. By comparison, Yan said the other three major waves included thetranslation of Buddhist texts in ancient China, the translation of Western literature and social science works during the late Qing dynasty, and the translation of modern works on humanities and social sciences after the Cultural Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many Chinese millennials, fansub work is also a way to learn about the world. Many groups don\\'t just do translation work â\\x80\\x94 they also add footnotes explaining background and context for certain dialogue to help Chinese audiences better understand historic, political or cultural references.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it\\'s a good thing for a child to be exposed to different cultures and different ways of thinking growing up,\" said Joy Tian, a 23-year-old English teacher in Beijing. She said she was struck by the individualistic values at the center of many Western series and films, having grown up in a culture that emphasizes collectivism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It helps promote diversity of thought,\" she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nXu, the Beijing-based lawyer, said it is up to the public to \"do some self-reflection\" following the crackdown on Renren Yingshi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no free lunch in this world, and they shouldn\\'t download or stream pirate films and TV shows anymore,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Tian stressed that she\\'d be willing to pay for the shows if they were uncensored. After all, she has paid for licensed American shows on legitimate Chinese streaming sites before â\\x80\\x94 but she couldn\\'t get past all of the editing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Xu said that Chinese fans will likely continue to be tempted to watch pirated shows. People who watch such content and don\\'t profit off of it have not, traditionally, been punished in China. And if the government doesn\\'t ease up on its rules on content, the demand won\\'t go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is indeed a problem. And as the government steps up its crackdown on copyright infringement, this problem will only become more acute,\" Xu said. \"With pirated access cut off, [the government and companies] should compensate by broadening legal access.\"',\n",

As you may have heard in our investor event a few days ago , people are subscribing to more and more services as the years go on. What used to be one to two services [that people subscribe to] and then became now three to four services is trending toward five services. We think that Paramount+ will absolutely be one of those services for consumers.\\r\\n\\r\\nViacomCBS has some of the most well-known names in TV history: MTV, CBS, Nickelodeon. Will those translate well to streaming?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all of those brands have over 90% brand awareness among consumers and stand for something essentially synonymous with those categories of content. So, MTV really epitomizes reality content. It used to be music, now it\\'s reality. Nickelodeon clearly is a leading brand for kids and Comedy Central stands for comedy in the television space. That combination of awareness, but their being synonymous with the content genres that they represent, we think is a very powerful combination.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBS All Access was one of the first major streaming services when it launched in 2014. Is it too late for Paramount+ to really get in this game?\\r\\n\\r\\nI think we have a great foundation with CBS All Access, who we\\'ve been in market for years in the streaming space. But CBS All Access was very CBS-focused, which of course predated the Viacom and CBS merger that happened a little over a year ago. Now, ViacomCBS is putting the full weight of the company behind turning CBS All Access into a much broader and bigger streaming service...\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'re just getting started and we\\'re going to be one of the leading players in the category for sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou were the former CEO of Pluto TV, which is an ad-supported service that looks just like regular TV. Is that concept the future of streaming?\\r\\n\\r\\nStreaming is going to look a lot like traditional TV has in certain ways, and that\\'s that you\\'re going to have a free lane, a broad pay lane and a premium pay lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we\\'re the only major media company playing in those categories as an ecosystem. So Pluto TV is our free offering, Paramount+ is our broad pay offering, and then we\\'ve got premium offerings in Showtime and BET+.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of those services stands for something for a particular consumer, but through that ecosystem we\\'re able to take advantage of the upsell possibilities ...

For the time being, though, mainland China remains off limits.(The company declined to specify how much it would spend.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re excited â\\x80\\x94 massively excited, I would say â\\x80\\x94 about the potential in Asia,\" Greg Peters, the company\\'s chief operating officer and chief product officer, told CNN Business. \"There\\'s literally hundreds and hundreds of millions of people that we\\'re still trying to find a great way to connect with and entertain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe content machine\\r\\n\\r\\nNetflix NFLX moved into Asia Pacific five years ago by launching in Japan. At the time, the California-based company was essentially \"a startup\" in the region, said Peters, adding that it had no local workers or even office space.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimes have changed. Three years ago, CEO Reed Hastings predicted that the \"next 100 million\" users would come from India alone, and the company has since seen \"big growth\" in viewing there. Netflix spent some $2 billion from 2018 to 2020 to either license or produce content in Asia, and has now amassed a library of more than 200 original Asian titles. It also employs about 600 staffers across the region and keeps its APAC headquarters in Singapore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winning formula relies in part on taking hit shows from the West and marketing or adapting them for other audiences. In 2019, it rolled out a special season of \"Queer Eye,\" where the cast performed makeovers in Japan. In December, it announced a South Korean version of \"Money Heist,\" a Spanish crime drama that has won critical and audience acclaim.\\r\\n\\r\\nA still from the set of \"Money Heist.\" Netflix announced last year that it would produce a Korean adaptation of the Spanish series.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the company has found that Asian audiences don\\'t just want to watch adaptations of Western shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Minyoung Kim joined Netflix in 2016 as its first Asia-based content executive, the company \"knew that local content was going to be a really important factor for growing our business in Asia,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We just didn\\'t have ... proof,\" added Kim, who is vice president of content for Netflix in South Korea, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, that\\'s no longer the case. Just as Netflix\\'s international shows have worked in different markets, the company has found that its Asian shows have appeal worldwide. Japan\\'s \"Alice in Borderland,\" South Korea\\'s \"Kingdom\" and \"Indian Matchmaking,\" which was shot between India and the United States, have all been breakout successes around the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo other factors have been driving Netflix\\'s growth in Asia. Last year, Korean dramas, or \"K-dramas,\" dominated its top 10 lists in Southeast Asia. Regional viewership for Korean content quadrupled last year compared to 2019. Regional viewership of Japanese anime, meanwhile, doubled year-over-year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA scene from \"Kingdom.\" The South Korean thriller was a recent hit for Netflix across countries. Credit: Netflix\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding an audience in Asia also means that Netflix has had to expand the number of languages it supports. The service is now available in 35 languages, including Hindi, Chinese, Vietnamese and Malay. It is continuing to add more, including subtitling and dubbing options.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon AMZN The company has also unveiled a cheaper mobile-only plan to cater to Asian audiences who watch a lot of TV on their phones, even at home. The offering started in India in 2019, and has since expanded to other countries, such as Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand. (has picked up on the trend, too, launching a mobile-only subscription for Prime Video in India last month.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPeters said that Asian viewers have also helped the company develop new technology that it has since rolled out globally. Someone trying to learn a foreign language, for example, might want to watch a show in slower motion. That led Netflix to introduce the ability to toggle video playback speed, which is now available worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulties of going global\\r\\n\\r\\nAs competition continues to heat up, the need for new content has only gotten stronger. In recent years, Netflix has lost parts of its catalog to studios that have launched their own streaming services (including HBO Max, owned by CNN\\'s parent WarnerMedia). By stocking up on original content, the company can hedge against the risk of losing subscribers to competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a letter to shareholders last month, the company acknowledged as much, saying it had been expecting more competition worldwide for years. \"This is, in part, why we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a wide range of genres and nations,\" it wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nSima Taparia, the star of \"Indian Matchmaking.\" The reality show, which followed the love lives of people in India and the United States, became an international sensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat line of thinking has allowed Netflix to build up an arsenal of new movies, series and documentaries, with more than 500 titles almost ready to launch. It even plans to release a new original film each week in 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney DIS The company faces some significant challenges in international markets, though. In India, for example,has partnered with local player Hotstar to offer live cricket matches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of the things that Disney/Hotstar has in India that they [Netflix] don\\'t have is live sports,\" said Neil Macker, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. \"Their competitors are using other things [to hook viewers].\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stand out, Netflix could partner with a wider range of players to find \"some way of creating more value than just simply the [streaming] service itself,\" Macker added.\\r\\n\\r\\nNetflix has also had to contend with political headaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019, it blocked an episode of the comedy show, \"Patriot Act,\" in Saudi Arabia that was critical of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The decision â\\x80\\x94 made in response to a legal request from officials â\\x80\\x94 was a \"troubling compromise,\" Hastings told CNN\\r\\n\\r\\nLast November, Netflix found itself in hot water in India. It became the subject of boycott calls and even police complaints after some politicians objected to the series \"A Suitable Boy,\" which featured a kissing scene between Hindu and Muslim characters at a Hindu temple. (The production was a BBC title acquired by Netflix.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked how the firm dealt with demands for censorship, Peters pledged to support \"creative freedom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We don\\'t have a particular agenda we\\'re trying to push,\" he said. \"We are not looking to harm or insult any group of people, but we are working with a diverse set of creators. And those diverse sets of creators have a wide set of perspectives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still one massive Asian market the company hasn\\'t been able to crack: mainland China. Netflix has tried to dip into the country before, with disappointing results.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the company told shareholders that the local \"regulatory environment\" had become an issue, though it still hoped to launch there \"eventually.\" The following year, it embarked on a largely fruitless licensing partnership with iQiyi, a Chinese streaming giant. (Netflix\\'s own service has never been available in mainland China.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The effect wasn\\'t that great, so we didn\\'t continue the partnership anymore,\" iQiyi CEO Gong Yu later told CNBC in an interview.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got no plans [to launch there] for the foreseeable future,\" said Peters. \"Really, we look at the opportunity outside of China.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven accounting for the company\\'s success elsewhere in Asia, though, Peters said it can\\'t afford to be complacent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothing I would say that I\\'m satisfied with. We have to constantly keep improving,\" he said. \"We\\'re connected with a lot of people around the world. But it\\'s not everybody, right? So we have more work to do.\"',\n",

       " 'Orleans, France (CNN Business) Balanced on two wheels without a protective shell, riding a motorbike is far more dangerous than driving a car. In the United States, for example, motorcyclists are about 28 times as likely as car occupants to die in a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut innovations in airbags could help keep motorcyclists safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses Shahrivar designed his first pair of motorcycle jeans in collaboration with Harley-Davidson Sweden 16 years ago â\\x80\\x94 featuring a protective leather lining. Now he is taking the idea one step further. His company Airbag Inside Sweden AB has designed a prototype pair of super-strong jeans that have concealed airbags inside the legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wearer tethers the jeans to their bike and if they fall from the motorcycle, the airbags are triggered, filling with compressed air and lessening the impact on the lower body. The airbag can then be deflated, refilled with gas and reassembled into the jeans to use again, explains Shahrivar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirbag Inside Sweden AB is in the process of getting the jeans certified to European health and safety standards and is putting them through a series of crash tests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company has raised â\\x82¬150,000 ($180,000) from the European Union to develop the idea and is hoping to bring the jeans to market in 2022. French company CX Air Dynamics has launched a crowdfunding campaign to develop a similar idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirbag vests\\r\\n\\r\\nShahrivar says it\\'s the first time this kind of protection will be available for the lower body.\\r\\n\\r\\nEquivalent technology for the upper body has been around for more than 20 years. Motorcycle airbag vests can be fitted under a jacket, and protect the chest, neck and sometimes the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly versions were tethered to the bike, like Shahrivar\\'s jeans, but more recently, autonomous electronic airbags have been developed, which instead use high-tech sensors to detect when the rider is about to fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the autonomous airbags on the market is a system created by French firm In&motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company started designing wearable airbags for professional skiers in 2011 and has since adapted the technology for motorcyclists. Rather than using a tether to trigger airbags, it has created a \"brain\" consisting of a GPS, gyroscope and accelerometer. A bit bigger than a smartphone, this box is placed in the back of any compatible vest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sensors measure movements in real time and the algorithm is able to detect a fall or an accident to inflate the airbag just before a crash,\" In&motion communication manager Anne-Laure Hoegeli tells CNN Business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe box measures the position of the rider 1,000 times per second. As soon as an \"unrecoverable imbalance\" is detected the airbag triggers and fully inflates to protect the user\\'s thorax, abdomen, neck and spine, explains Hoegeli. This takes just 60 milliseconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn&motion makes high-tech airbag vests.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn&motion recently raised â\\x82¬10 million ($12 million) in funding to expand in Europe and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the basic operation is similar to other electronic airbags on the market, In&motion has an affordable subscription service, explains Emma Franklin, deputy editor of Motorcycle News. \"Their system has in many ways made airbags more attainable for everyday people,\" Franklin tells CNN Business.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiders can either buy the box outright for $400 or rent it from In&motion for about $120 a year. Users in France also have access to a setting that calls emergency services in the event of a crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Frampton, a senior lecturer in vehicle safety at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom, says there hasn\\'t been much academic research into the effectiveness of motorcycle airbag vests, as they are still fairly new for road riders. But he pointed to research from the French Institute of Science and Technology for Transport, Development and Networks, which found airbag vests offered good protection at impact speeds lower than around 30 to 40 kilometers per hour (18 to 25 miles per hour).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the few papers, case studies and articles I\\'ve seen, they look to be a very useful device,\" says Frampton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m in favor of them â\\x80\\x94 the chest, neck and spine are all areas where you can get life-threatening injuries.\"',\n",

       " \"The truthtellersâ\\x80\\x99 legacy\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough to silence the truthtellers. The Chinese Communist Party needed to create its own storyline, both to cover up its initial missteps and to deflect the reputational damage caused by China being the country where the first cases were detected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts first step in February was to deploy hundreds of state media journalists to Wuhan to be its eyes and ears on the ground. Although their reports were often censored, they served a dual purpose of helping to gather information for the party, something that often happens during public emergencies in China, said Mary Gallagher, the director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan and an expert in Chinese politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor months, Chinese government spokespeople and state media have pushed the narrative that the virus may have originated outside of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy March, daily cases had fallen to double digits and much of China had emerged from lockdown. By May, China had largely controlled the virus within its own borders and its coronavirus case numbers were quickly dwarfed by skyrocketing numbers in the United States and Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following months, China seized on that success to push the narrative it had handled the outbreak better than almost any country -- proof its authoritarian response were a model to be admired and replicated. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed criticism that it had cracked down on journalists and doctors, saying: â\\x80\\x9cThe Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the official truth scrubbed from the Chinese internet, Beijing began to fill that void with alternative timelines that painted China in a more favorable light.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficials promoted baseless arguments that the virus could have started elsewhere, including the theory US army personnel could have brought the virus to China when they came to Wuhan for the Military World Games in October 2019. In January 2021, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying added legitimacy to the theory coronavirus might have come from another country when she called on the US to invite the WHO to visit American sites so they could study the origins of the virus. Last year, state media seized on studies which found evidence Covid-19 circulated in Italy as early as September 2019, portraying the report as evidence the virus didnâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily originate in China, despite that not being what its authors suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October, China launched an exhibition in Wuhan, featuring interactive displays promoting the idea of a heroic response to the virus. Many of the truthtellers -- including Chen Mei, doctor Ai Fen, and university professor Zhang Yongzhen -- were nowhere to be seen. The whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang was included in a wall of martyrs, but his brief biography didnâ\\x80\\x99t include that heâ\\x80\\x99d been reprimanded for trying to warn colleagues about the coronavirus.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinaâ\\x80\\x99s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and State Council Information Office did not respond to a request to explain why Chinese officials had pushed the narrative that the virus originated outside China, and whether the government was concerned that its actions could discourage doctors and journalists from speaking out about future pandemics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s evidence that these efforts have been effective within China. A study published in November by international research and data analytics group YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project found that, in nearly all countries, the vast majority of people thought Covid-19 originated in China. But in China, more than half said the virus had originated in China, while a third thought it had come from the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nControlling the narrative has always been important to Chinese leaders, but censorship has tightened under President Xi Jinping, and the partyâ\\x80\\x99s ability to communicate its own perspective has improved. â\\x80\\x9cThe connection the (CCP) donâ\\x80\\x99t want people to make is that freedom of speech can affect not just your livelihood, but your existence,â\\x80\\x9d Gallagher said. â\\x80\\x9c(Controlling the narrative) is a way for the Chinese government to demonstrate that it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need to change its political systems.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition about Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s fight against Covid-19 at a convention center that was previously a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients in Wuhan.Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Displays at the exhibition showing President Xi Jinping.Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty A â\\x80\\x9cwall of martyrsâ\\x80\\x9d at the exhibition, including Dr. Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the Covid-19 outbreak.Ng Han Guan/AP\\r\\n\\r\\nThat isnâ\\x80\\x99t just a problem for people seeking free and fair information in China -- it impacts the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow many doctors are going to come out and report the next one?â\\x80\\x9d said Annie Sparrow, an assistant professor of population health science and policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\\r\\n\\r\\nCovid-19 has killed more than 2 million people worldwide -- knowing how the pandemic took hold remains key to preventing this from repeating.

       " '\"(We hope) that following China\\'s example, the US side will act in a positive, science-based and cooperative manner on the origin-tracing issue (and) invite WHO experts in for an origin-tracing study,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said last week\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing even further, Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at China\\'s Center for Disease Control, said the US should now be \"the focus\" of global efforts to trace the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Chinese officials should point to the US when discussing the origins of a virus first detected in central China may at first appear confusing to many.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for months now, China has been advancing alternative theories for how the coronavirus first emerged, ones that would obviate any blame officials in Wuhan may bear for not reacting quickly enough to the initial outbreak in that city in late 2019, during which they are accused of dragging their feet as evidence of human-to-human spread became clear and the virus ran rampant.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Chinese theory in particular emerged early on in the pandemic but gained significant traction in recent weeks, as the WHO investigation and new outbreaks of the coronavirus in China renewed attention both internally and externally on the government\\'s alleged failures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many ways, this theory is the mirror image of a conspiracy about China alleging that the virus might have emerged -- either intentionally or by mistake -- from a lab in Wuhan focused on researching deadly pathogens. That this did not happen is one of the few definitive statements the WHO team were able to make after their trip to the city this month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(Our) findings suggest that the laboratory incident hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain introduction of the virus into the human population, and therefore is not a hypothesis that implies to suggest future studies into our work, to support our future work, into the understanding of the origin of the virus,\" Peter Ben Embarek, a member of the team, said at a press conference announcing their findings held before the team left China.\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Detrick, a US Army base in Maryland, has become the focus of Chinese conspiracy theories about the coronavirus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, however, Zeng, the Chinese CDC official, was advancing just such a hypothesis, not about the Wuhan lab, but Fort Detrick, a US Army biomedical research laboratory in Maryland. There is no evidence to support this theory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The US has biological laboratories all over the world,\" he told a Shanghai-based website, in an interview which linked Fort Detrick, and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) based there, to research carried out by the notorious Unit 731 of the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why does the US have so many laboratories? What is the purpose of this?\" Zeng said. \"In many things, the US requires others to be open and transparent. In the end, it turns out that the US itself is often the most opaque.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that the coronavirus may have emerged from a lab, that the pandemic which ground the world to a halt may have been man-made, is not isolated to China. Many US politicians and conspiracists have pushed the idea that a Chinese lab might have been responsible, while others have posited alternative supposed bioweapon creators, including the US itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nA survey carried out by Pew in April 2020 found that some 30% of Americans believed the virus was created in a lab, with most of those claiming it was created intentionally.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround that time, leading members of then-US President Donald Trump\\'s administration, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, attempted to link the Wuhan Institute of Virology to the coronavirus , implying it might have escaped -- or even been released -- from the lab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis claim was angrily rejected by China and rebuked by leading scientists working on the virus. Following an inspection of the lab itself this month, the WHO team largely dismissed it in a press conference as a possible origin of the Wuhan outbreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a CNN investigation, growing scrutiny of the lab in early 2020, along with criticism of China\\'s initial handling of the pandemic, appears to have prompted the Communist Party\\'s propaganda organs to adopt the Fort Detrick conspiracy as a potential counter, a disinformation mirror to deflect criticism both legitimate and groundless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as attention returned to Wuhan at the start of this year, promotion of this conspiracy has redoubled, with a web of official government accounts, influencers, and state media spreading this disinformation to tens of millions of user online.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngela Xiao Wu, an assistant professor at NYU Steinhardt who has studied efforts at shaping online opinion in China, said it was \"surely an effective tactic for the Party-state to direct people\\'s critical attention outwards as a way to channel their fears and frustrations,\" though she added many other governments had adopted similar tactics, \"including the Trump Administration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN\\'s findings, detailed below, match those of a separate investigation published this month by the Associated Press in conjunction with the Atlantic Council\\'s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab).\\r\\n\\r\\nJUST WATCHED A year after lockdown, Wuhan begins to return to normal life Replay More Videos ...

In January 2020, according to state media, a man in Inner Mongolia was arrested for spreading rumors after a video he made claiming the virus was a US bioweapon was watched almost 14,000 times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis attitude shifted, however, as Chinese authorities faced growing criticism both at home and abroad. In Washington, the Trump administration, flailing in its own domestic response and facing growing case numbers, lashed out at Beijing. In China, anger was growing over the death of Li Wenliang , a Wuhan doctor and whistleblower, who was reprimanded by police for sharing information about the virus, before succumbing to it himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout March and April, reports in Chinese state media began to focus on Fort Detrick, culminating in an article in the People\\'s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, calling on the US government to give \"clear answers to the world\" about the USAMRIID lab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genesis of the conspiracy, the nugget of truth upon which all the other false claims have been layered, is an incident from 2019, when CDC inspectors briefly halted research at USAMRIID, over safety concerns. At the time, the lab was working on pathogens including Ebola, Zika, and plague.\\r\\n\\r\\nA file photo of a research lab at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick.\\r\\n\\r\\nA spokeswoman for the lab told the Army Times in 2019 that the issues stemmed from when the lab switched from steam sterilization to a chemical system the previous year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The new system necessitated numerous changes in laboratory infrastructure, procedures, and work practices that substantially increased the complexity of operating in containment laboratories,\" public affairs officer Caree Vander Linden said. \"Mechanical issues and human error were among the issues cited by CDC in issuing the suspension.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough multiple public investigations of the 2019 incident, by both the CDC and several media outlets, did not find any evidence of danger, or make any references to coronaviruses, it is easy to see how any story involving the lab could potentially give rise to conspiracies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to shifting its focus to defending against biological weapons and natural pathogens, Fort Detrick hosted Washington\\'s own offensive bio-weapons program, which ended in 1969. It has also been linked to CIA research into mind control during the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public investigation clearing the lab did not stop some claiming there were supposedly unanswered questions about its workings, however, and in March 2020 a petition posted to the White House \"We the People\" website calling for an investigation was heavily promoted in Chinese media and on social platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"(USAMRIID) was once ordered to halt the study of biological select agents and toxins,\" the People\\'s Daily said in a report referencing the petition. \"Given that these issues have become a primary public concern, what is the US government\\'s response?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy May, as relations between the US and China continued to plummet over the coronavirus pandemic, and Trump\\'s attempts to divert from his administration\\'s handling of it, the Fort Detrick conspiracy reached the mouths of China\\'s top diplomats.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a press conference on May 6, in response to a question about the Wuhan lab origin, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying referenced reports about Fort Detrick, and called on the US government to \"accept investigation and address these concerns,\" driving the theory fully into the mainstream in China, with numerous outlets publishing reports on the alleged \"cover-up,\" while a widely-shared video compared it to Unit 731.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs China largely recovered from the pandemic and returned to normal in the latter half of 2020, the Fort Detrick theory faded from consciousness somewhat, replaced by more plausible -- though highly contested -- claims that the virus might have been circulating in other countries and could have entered Wuhan via frozen food supply chains, a theory the WHO team offered a tacit endorsement of this month in a press conference, saying it was worth further investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUST WATCHED China bans BBC News after UK pulls CGTN\\'s license Replay More Videos ...

       " 'Melbourne, Australia (CNN Business) South Australian winemaker Jarrad White spent almost a decade building his business in China. Then, in a matter of months, it all fell apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had nothing to do with the quality of White\\'s wines at his vineyard in McLaren Vale, one of South Australia\\'s premier winegrowing regions. Instead, it was the result of months of worsening diplomatic frictions between China and Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite lived in Shanghai for several years, setting up a network of distributors to sell his Jarressa Estate wine to the booming Chinese market, where demand for foreign wines among the middle class was growing fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-2020, more than 96% of Jaressa Estate\\'s wines were being sold to consumers in China, up to seven million bottles a year. But in November, Beijing announced crippling tariffs on Australian wine as part of an \"anti-dumping investigation\" into whether those wines were being sold too cheaply in China. The government said the probe was prompted by complaints from Chinese wine producers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite says he hasn\\'t sold a single bottle since.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrapes on the vine at Tahbilk winery in central Victoria in February 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, hundreds of thousands of bottles of Jarressa Estate wine are piled on pallets in a warehouse in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, waiting for the tariffs to be lifted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s hurting us dramatically. We had a lot of supplies that needed to be paid for and all these orders that were planned to shift, so it\\'s left us in an awkward situation,\" White said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe isn\\'t alone. Hundreds of Australian wine producers who invested heavily in China\\'s wine boom are now facing an uncertain future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value of exports of wine to China dropped to almost zero in December, according to statistics from industry group Wine Australia. The total value of wine exported to China for all of 2020 dropped by 14% to about 1 billion Australian dollars ($790 million).\\r\\n\\r\\nChina maintains the measures are needed to stop cheap wine imports from depressing the local market. But the Australian wine industry believes it has more to do with worsening tensions between the two countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt isn\\'t just wine. As relations between Canberra and Beijing spiral, many Australian exports, including beef and timber, started encountering obstacles entering the China market, and there\\'s little optimism things will improve any time soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nA customer looks at a bottle of wine imported from Australia at a supermarket on November 27 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wine boom\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia is the world\\'s fifth-largest wine exporter and home to some of the world\\'s most-famous wine regions, such as the Barossa Valley in South Australia and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Wine Australia, the wine industry contributes up to $35 billion (45 billion Australian dollars) to the country\\'s economy annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore November, China was Australia\\'s biggest wine market by far. In 2019, more than a third of the wine that Australia exported went to China. The country bought $840 million ( 1.1 billion Australian dollars) from Australian vineyards, according to Wine Australia. That year, Australia sold more wine by value to China than to the United States, United Kingdom and Canada combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlister Purbrick, a fourth-generation Victorian wine maker and chief executive of the Tahbilk Group, said that Australia had been building its wine business in China for years, but it had only really taken off after the two countries signed a free trade agreement in 2015, which removed 14% tariffs on Australian wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe removal of tariffs supercharged a growing industry. Between 2008 and 2018 , Australia\\'s wine exports to China jumped from $73 million to over $1 billion.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina\\'s demand for wine isn\\'t limited to Australia. France is the still leading exporter of wine to China. Australia comes in second, and there is also strong demand for Chilean labels.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Australian wine, red varieties are the most popular in China, Purbrick said, although recently consumers had begun to branch out into sparkling and white wines.\\r\\n\\r\\nZheng Li, who owns a wine business in Hangzhou, said he thinks Australian wine has found success in China because it is, in his opinion, better than the wines produced elsewhere â\\x80\\x94 and it\\'s also cheaper, mostly thanks to the free trade agreement between the two countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe added that the higher alcohol content is also appealing to Chinese drinkers who are used to baijiu, a popular, strong liquor made from rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother perk: Chinese consumers find the labeling system Australian winemakers use easier to understand than the regional labeling used by European companies, Zheng said. For example, Treasury Wines\\' popular Penfolds brand labels its wine by Bins â\\x80\\x94 as in Bin 8, Bin 28, Bin 389 â\\x80\\x94 which refer to where the wine is stored before being sold.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Australian winemakers also attribute the popularity of Australian wines to what they describe as the country\\'s clean environment and appealing climate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no denying the quality of the Australian wine and the purity of the country, the climate, the product, it\\'s clean, it\\'s pure and a very good quality wine, very palatable,\" said White from Jarressa Estate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the wine boom was also the product of years of work by Australia, which targeted the growing Chinese middle class with advertising and education campaigns, according to Lee McLean, Wine Australia\\'s general manager of government relations and external affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese sommeliers and winemakers were brought to Australia, McLean said, along with tour groups who would visit vineyards to sample the produce. Purdick, from the Tahbilk Group, said that some Melbourne vineyards employed Mandarin translators for the Chinese tour groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlister Purbrick, chief executive of the Tahbilk Group, walks through his vineyard in central Victoria in February 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Effectively zero\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before the tariffs, Australia\\'s wine industry was having a difficult year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA series of terrible weather events hurt yields by as much as 40% in the first half of 2020, Purdick said, including hail storms, drought and the catastrophic summer bushfires which caused \"smoke taint\" in some vineyards\\' harvests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coronavirus pandemic, meanwhile, led to reduced orders from China and elsewhere as economic growth slowed around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"[But] those two effects have been a walk in the park compared to the China effect,\" said Purdick.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical relations between Australia and China began to rapidly deteriorate in April after Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an international investigation into the origins of Covid-19.\\r\\n\\r\\nand Chinese Ambassador to Australia Chen Jingye Beijing was furious. China\\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called Morrison\\'s comments \"highly irresponsible,\" and Chinese Ambassador to Australia Chen Jingye openly mused about the possibility of economic fallout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe the ordinary [Chinese] people will say \\'Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?\\'\" he told the Australian Financial Review at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterward, a number of Australian exports â\\x80\\x94 including timber, beef, some types of coal and eventually, wine â\\x80\\x94 began to encounter difficulties entering the China market.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced an \"anti-dumping investigation\" into Australian wine, which led the ministry in November to impose temporary tariffs of up to 212%. It isn\\'t clear at this stage when the tariffs will expire or be made permanent.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUST WATCHED Australian trade minister: China tariffs a \\'devastating blow\\' to wine industry Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Australian trade minister: China tariffs a \\'devastating blow\\' to wine industry 02:32\\r\\n\\r\\nPurbrick said that a quarter of the exports from his family\\'s Tahbilk Winery, which has operated for more than a century, had been to China. Now that business is gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now it is effectively zero sales, or very small sales, into China,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWine barrels and pallets of bottles are stacked at a winery in the Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia, on December 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blame game\\r\\n\\r\\nMany winemakers in Australia are convinced that the tariffs are political retaliation by China in response to Australia\\'s calls for an investigation into the Covid-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nof the problems to Australia, saying that the country had \"violated the basic norms governing international relations.\" Beijing hasn\\'t shied away from connecting the trade tensions to political disputes between the two countries, either. Asked about the trade tensions in November, China\\'s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying attributed the \"root cause\" of the problemsto Australia, saying that the country had \"violated the basic norms governing international relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"[They] said and did the wrong things on issues related to Hong Kong and Xinjiang concerning China\\'s core interests. China has made clear our position on multiple occasions,\" she said, referring to the Australian government\\'s rebuke of China over alleged human rights abuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nVintners who spoke to CNN Business mostly said that they didn\\'t blame the Australian government for the predicament. They said they believed that Canberra had done its best to negotiate with China â\\x80\\x94 though Tahbilk Group\\'s Purbrick said Canberra could perhaps have handled its calls for a Covid-19 investigation a bit more diplomatically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Australia\\'s only a little nation. We should have absolutely supported it, but we didn\\'t need to lead the charge,\" Purdick said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers in Australia lay some blame at the door of the Chinese wine industry, which they claim pushed for action due to concerns over the growing popularity of Australian wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt firmly pointed the finger at Australia, whose wine exports to China more than doubled over the same period. In its application to the Ministry of Commerce to take action, the China Alcoholic Drinks Association said domestic wine production shrank 61% between 2015 and 2019.It firmly pointed the finger at Australia, whose wine exports to China more than doubled over the same period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe domestic industry is \"deteriorating rapidly,\" the application said, adding that low-price Australian wine is \"damaging the domestic industry\" in China.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its response , Australian Grape and Wine, Australia\\'s national association of winegrape and wine producers, said Australian imports were not to blame for the downturn in China\\'s domestic wine industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuoting analysis by drinks market research firm International Wine and Spirits Research, it said local Chinese wines were \"beset by structural problems arising from the rush to increase production during the 1990s and 2000s. These include high costs, unsuitable soils and climates, excessive yields, poor quality and image.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChina\\'s local wine industry doesn\\'t have the capacity to meet the growing demand for \" high quality wines ,\" it said, adding that other countries were exporting wine to China in higher volumes and at lower prices than Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBruce Tyrrell, managing director of Tyrrell\\'s Wines in New South Wales, put it this way: \"The sales of domestic Chinese wine started to decline and the Chinese wine markers started to say, \\'Get these bloody Australian winemakers out of our market.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe added: \"I\\'m sure my answer was, \\'Make better wine.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTyrrell said that while China had made up as much as 25% of his business, his winery was now treating it as a non-market. He added: \"Somebody said to me, \\'Who are going to be the biggest losers out of this?\\' and I said, \\'The Chinese consumers.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple Chinese vineyard owners turned down requests for comment from CNN Business, saying the situation was \"too sensitive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChina\\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in November, after the tariffs were announced, that the Chinese government believed a sound and stable relationship with Australia was \"in the interests of both countries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is hoped that the Australian side will do more things conducive to mutual trust and cooperation as is in line with the two sides\\' comprehensive strategic partnership,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, it will be up to the World Trade Organization to decide how valid the anti-dumping claims are, according to Sean Langcake, principal economist at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhoever is to blame, Australian vineyards are suffering. Even winemakers with no footprint in the China market are now facing a likely drop in domestic wine prices, as vintners flood the Australian market with product they can\\'t sell overseas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, after a difficult 2020 wine harvest, Purbrick said that 2021 was shaping up to be a better harvest than usual, exacerbating problems with a glut of wine which Australian producers can\\'t export.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m concerned across the whole industry ... There\\'s no winners in a situation like that,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew markets\\r\\n\\r\\nAs some Australian winemakers look overseas for new markets, there are quiet concerns that if the China market goes for good, there simply isn\\'t anything that can replace it in terms of buying power.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome vintners told CNN Business that they are hopeful that India, with its rapidly growing economy and middle class, might be an option, while others said they are looking to develop more obscure markets like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new free trade deal with the United Kingdom in the wake of Brexit might also open up opportunities, if it leads to tariffs being reduced on Australian wines coming into Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite, from Jarressa Estates, said that the coronavirus is making traveling overseas to look for new buyers incredibly hard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These things take the ability to do international travel and time and money,\" he said. \"It isn\\'t just a matter of, \\'Oh, we have all this stock, let\\'s ship it to America or Europe.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite said that he hoped that the dispute would be resolved within a year, but other vintners aren\\'t expecting a break anytime soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think the reality is that we are probably facing a situation which is likely to be with us for years rather than months,\" said Wine Australia\\'s Lee McLean.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo wine importers in China who spoke to CNN Business anonymously, to protect their domestic business, said that the ban wouldn\\'t affect much of their business as Australian wine could be easily replaced by Chilean wine, which is also produced in the southern hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome winemakers in Australia were doubtful though, saying that while some varieties of Chilean wine may have a similar taste and price, those winemakers couldn\\'t replace the more high-end Australian labels, such as Penfolds.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the tariffs are eased relatively quickly, the episode is likely to reshape Australia\\'s wine industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nPurbrick, of the Tahbilk Group, said that in future it was unlikely Australian winemakers would allow themselves to become so heavily reliant on China or any single market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a few very good lessons to be learned out of this current scenario,\" he said. \"How far can we go with a customer or a market where if it falls over tomorrow, it\\'s not going to kill us?\"',\n",

       " 'It was almost midnight in the southern Thai city of Trang, and I was staring into an oven the size of a tuk-tuk. Flames and smoke were shooting out of the top, and men were carefully lowering two full-grown, slaughtered pigs into the fiery abyss. An hour later, they would be pulled out, smoking, crimson, crispy and fragrant. When cool enough to handle, the pigs would be portioned, chopped up and displayed for sale at Trangâ\\x80\\x99s central morning market by about by 04:00.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was staring into an oven the size of a tuk-tuk\\r\\n\\r\\nThere arenâ\\x80\\x99t many places in the world where people are willing to accommodate the logistics required to roast entire full-grown pigs every day. But there also arenâ\\x80\\x99t many places in the world that are as serious about breakfast as Trang. Even in an utterly food-obsessed country like Thailand, the cityâ\\x80\\x99s enthusiasm for the first meal of the day can seem almost pathological.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Trang, you can kick off your day at immense dim sum halls; decades-old restaurants selling steaming bowls of noodles and rice porridge; cafes and stalls boasting trays of curries, stir-frys and soups; street-side vendors hawking crispy, deep-fried sticks of dough; and most famously, stalls selling local-style roast pork by the kilogram. Itâ\\x80\\x99s fun, indulgent, delicious and overwhelming. But why breakfast and why Trang?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRestaurants in Trang accommodate the various types of workers here,â\\x80\\x9d explained Khanaporn Janjirdsak, a Trang-based restaurateur and amateur food historian, when I asked her why Trang was so mad about breakfast. â\\x80\\x9cRubber tappers wake up at 02:00, people who run restaurants go shopping for ingredients at 05:00; people here are eating all the time!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople here are eating all the time!\\r\\n\\r\\nRubber is an important crop in the countryside surrounding Trang, Khanaporn told me, and the fact that rubber sap must be gathered in the morning hours had led to a robust â\\x80\\x93 and very early â\\x80\\x93 breakfast culture. In some cases, she said, rubber tappers may have already eaten two meals before the sun has risen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother factor that has shaped the cityâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast scene is immigration. Since the 15th Century, trade, commerce and the prospect of work have drawn Chinese immigrants to various points along Thailandâ\\x80\\x99s Andaman Sea coast. Trang became home to a disproportionate number of these, and as a result, it just might be the most Chinese place in Thailand: a virtual melting pot of Chinese culture, with Hakka, Hokkien and Teochew among the regional Chinese languages spoken there. Yet, itâ\\x80\\x99s the Cantonese who have had the biggest impact on Trangâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the old days, people would just come and drink tea,â\\x80\\x9d explained Yaowanee Thirakleela, the fourth-generation Cantonese owner of Jip Khao, Trangâ\\x80\\x99s most longstanding and revered venue for dim sum. We were sitting in her restaurant, which at 07:00, was already packed with families, schoolkids, pensioners and people on their way to the office. â\\x80\\x9cThere werenâ\\x80\\x99t many things to eat with the tea; a couple steamed dumplings, maybe deep-fried sticks of dough.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYet over the decades, Thirakleela told me, Trangâ\\x80\\x99s teahouses started to offer more food items, ultimately making the transition to full-fledged restaurants. Today, the city is synonymous with vast dim sum halls that offer dozens of steamed and deep-fried options, as well as noodles and rice dishes. But Jip Khao is one of the few that has maintained a relatively small menu of dim sum items, all made in-house and steamed in the traditional style in a wide tray rather than in tiny bamboo baskets.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may also be interested in:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80¢ Japan\\'s secret udon mecca\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80¢ The 850m-long bridge uniting a town\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80¢ The birthplace of traditional Thai massage\\r\\n\\r\\nCast aside any notions of delicate, jewel-like, seafood-based dumplings; Trang-style dim sum is homely and hearty, the almost exclusively pork-based fillings given a seemingly Thai-influenced oomph from generous additions of garlic and white pepper. And remnants of Chinese tea culture can still be seen in the drinks station standard at Jip Khao and its counterparts, where mostly sweet cups of coffee and tea are poured through a sock-like cloth filter. Thirakleela is proud that her restaurant is perhaps the only one in town that continues to serve Chinese tea the old-school way â\\x80\\x93 from cup-like teapots and spiked with fragrant chrysanthemum petals.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s time, they drank lots of tea,â\\x80\\x9d she told me. â\\x80\\x9cThey could eat fatty food and still live long lives!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fatty food Thirakleela was referring to was, undoubtedly, Trangâ\\x80\\x99s famous roast pork. Although the dish has its origins in Chinese festivals and celebrations, it has become synonymous with Trang, and these days is sold from stalls at the municipal morning market and dim sum halls alike, a staple indulgence for locals and a must-eat item for visitors. The pigs, deboned, scored deeply and rubbed with a sweet, fragrant five-spice-based marinade, emerge from ovens like the one I witnessed that night with an almost tooth-shatteringly crispy skin, firm, candy-like lean meat and a layer of fat that, when done well, is at the verge of melting.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t need a dip for Trang-style roast pork,â\\x80\\x9d said Janjirdsak, when I asked her to describe her cityâ\\x80\\x99s signature dish. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s already seasoned â\\x80\\x93 the taste is already perfect.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI get up every day at 03:00 to prepare the dough\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, diners at Trangâ\\x80\\x99s popular dim sum halls like Trang Moo Yang and Phong O Cha 1 pair tiny plates of roast pork with steamed buns and the clockwork of meat being hacked apart with a giant cleaver. Street-side, and at Trangâ\\x80\\x99s central morning market, a brisk trade is done in take-away boxes of roast pork, with customers pulling up on motorcycles, shouting an order for a kilogram or two, and speeding away without having even disembarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly second to dim sum and roast pork is Trangâ\\x80\\x99s affinity for sticks of deep-fried dough â\\x80\\x93 yet another Chinese breakfast staple.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI get up every day at 03:00 to prepare the dough,â\\x80\\x9d explained Somyot Athakijmongkol, the second-generation owner of Kun Chiang Bang Rak, a tiny, shophouse-bound, breakfast-only restaurant that serves what are arguably the best sticks in town. â\\x80\\x9cI start frying the dough at 06:00. And we usually sell out by 09:00.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAthakijmongkol spoke to me as he shaped, flipped, pinched and divided a mound of almost ethereally soft, pale dough. After the mass had been transformed into a row of approximately cigarette lighter-sized sticks, he took two and stuck them together, which he slid into a vast wok of hot oil, flipping crosses with long chopsticks until glassy and golden.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople in Trang eat nine times a day!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOurs are longer, crispier â\\x80\\x93 they stay crispy a long time,â\\x80\\x9d he told me, when I asked what made his product superior, â\\x80\\x9cand theyâ\\x80\\x99re soft inside.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the ubiquity of deep-fried sticks of dough in Trang that on top of the table of any dim sum hall is dispenser holding squares of thick, coarse gray paper. Locals know to use these to dab excess oil from sticks of dough and, I was told, to jot down figures while talking business over dim sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Trangâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast scene isnâ\\x80\\x99t limited to Chinese dishes. Like much of southern Thailand, the city has a significant Muslim population, and from a string of open-air halal restaurants near Trangâ\\x80\\x99s train station, vendors sell flaky, crispy, fried flatbreads known as roti, pairing them with fragrant curries of dried spices that are more India than Thailand. Nearby, ethnic Thais, who, ironically, have probably had the least impact on Trangâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast scene, operate curry stalls, establishments that boast dozens of trays of pre-made curries, stir-frys, soups and other dishes. Although typically lunch fare elsewhere in Thailand, in Trang, these dishes are considered breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at Ko Lay, a Thai-run curry stall on Thanon Kan Tang street that typically sells out as early as 09:00, that I fell into conversation with the owner, Thanatip Boonyarat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe people of Trang have a reputation as serious eaters,â\\x80\\x9d she told me. â\\x80\\x9cPeople elsewhere [in Thailand] eat three maybe four times per day, but people in Trang eat nine times a day!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, admittedly, my second breakfast that day. Clearly I was starting to understand the local approach to eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

       " 'Predict-PD is one such initiative. According to Alastair Noyce, a clinical senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, who leads the project, it has developed a smell test called Scratch and Sniff. This is a quick test that presents six smells to the patient that we commonly encounter throughout the day, based off a larger roster of 40 odours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hope is the data they collect could be used to predict who is going to develop Parkinson\\'s, which might lead to new early treatments that could prevent the disease from progressing or slow it down. And with up to 0.45-3.4% of individuals (depending on the test) apparently unaware of their own smell loss, tools such as Predict-PD could help people to identify it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catch is that such tests are currently expensive. \"The standard smell test costs on average Â£25 [$34.88] to undertake but only a few pence to produce,\" says Noyce. Whilst cost may not be a barrier for the many private clinics that are using smell tests as a tool for diagnosis, it would limit its usefulness for public healthcare systems with limited resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, smell impairment does not only develop as a result of neurodegenerative diseases. Around 19% of the population have some sort of olfactory dysfunction, with 0.3% losing their sense of smell entirely (anosmia) and 19.1% suffering from reduced ability to detect odours (hyposomia). Recent studies have found that smell loss may be linked to mental health conditions such as depression, schizophrenia and dystonia, a movement disorder in which a person\\'s muscles contract uncontrollably.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study from 2016 found that men (but not women) with symptoms of depression also tended to have a poor sense of smell, while those who felt lonely were generally less good at identifying different smells. Other research has linked a defective sense of smell to increased mortality, suggesting it could be a \"bellweather\" for aging or illness. One study of more than 2,200 people aged 71-82 years old finding that those with a poor sense of smell had a 46% higher risk of dying within a ten year period than those with an ordinary sense of smell.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how is it that smell can have such a powerful link to our health?\\r\\n\\r\\nCarl Philpott, professor of rhinology and olfactology at the University of East Anglia, believes there could be a link to what we eat. According to his research, \"one-third of patients with smell loss overconsume and another one-third of patients under-consume\", he says. Since a healthy diet is one of the pillars of good health, it is easy to see why this would lead to increased mortality.',\n",
       " \"â\\x80\\x9cThe frustrating thing is that we have known for four or five decades what attributes we should be selecting forâ\\x80¦ and yet we don't do it,â\\x80\\x9d says Chamorro-Premuzic, who also serves as the chief talent scientist at the workforce solutions company ManpowerGroup. â\\x80\\x9cWe started focusing so much on style, extraversion, assertiveness, lean in, be confident, brand yourself, make eye contact, body language, that we forgot to focus on substance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even if arrogance doesnâ\\x80\\x99t win over a hiring manager, similarities in race, gender, self-presentation and personal experiences can increase a workerâ\\x80\\x99s chances of success.

       " 'There are only around 20 days a year when the law allows you to go down to the shoreline on the English Channel Island of Guernsey in search of a prized mollusc that, when French was the dominant language here until the late 19th Century, was known as oreille de mer (sea ear) â\\x80\\x93 though one engaging variation dubbed it â\\x80\\x9cVenus Earâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow known as ormer, this is the most northerly member of the abalone family, with dozens of global cousins found in places as far apart as Senegal, Australia, Japan and California. But only in the Channel Islands are they gathered by hand off the seashore â\\x80\\x93 and wrapped in a host of rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrmers are as distinctive as Guernsey itself. The island has been a British Crown Dependency for 800 years, despite sitting a few miles off the coast of France. Rustic â\\x80\\x9cparishesâ\\x80\\x9d bearing sturdy Anglo-Saxon names like St Sampsons and St Peters frame bays with Gallic names like Petit Bot and Lâ\\x80\\x99Ancresse, attracting painters like Renoir to capture their beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis melange of national influences extends to an old island language now making a comeback in schools and the media after a couple of centuries in the doldrums. Rooted in ancient Norman French, Guernesiaise is used in official ceremonies, as well as naming traditional local dishes like the apple cake gÃ¢che mÃªlaÃ¯e (pronounced â\\x80\\x9cgosh malarâ\\x80\\x9d).\\r\\n\\r\\nOrmers are as distinctive as Guernsey itself\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you know what to expect from apple cake, ormers are harder to pin down. â\\x80\\x9cThey\\'re the Marmite of the mollusc menu,â\\x80\\x9d admitted long-time ormer gatherer Peter Perrio. â\\x80\\x9cPeople seem to either love them or hate them with equal intensity.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who love them, the intensity is, well, pretty intense. One early culinary reference in 1673 described ormer as â\\x80\\x9cmuch bigger than an oyster... but infinitely more pleasant to the gusto, so that an epicure would think his pallat in paradise if he might but always gormandise on such delitious ambrosiaâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree centuries later, in his 1981 work The Book of Ebenezer LePage â\\x80\\x93 a fictional reflection of one man\\'s life on Guernsey â\\x80\\x93 Gerald Basil Edwards wrote: â\\x80\\x9cThe food I like best of all foods is ormers; [but] I canâ\\x80\\x99t say what ormers taste like. They are not like fish, flesh or fowl. They are like no other food on Earth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulty of pinning down the taste for newcomers remains. In a 2011 UK Aquatic Plant Society thread, one user opined that ormers â\\x80\\x9chave a unique flavour that is not really in most people\\'s vocabulary to describe! They are delicious but, not even remotely fishy tasting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Taste Atlas â\\x80\\x93 an online global guide to myriad traditional foodstuffs â\\x80\\x93 also hedged its bets, describing ormer in positive but rather vague terms. â\\x80\\x9cIts flesh is succulent and has a unique, mild, and slightly meat-like, but still distinctively molluscan flavour.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may also be interested in:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80¢ The English town that lured Tom Cruise\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80¢ The dish that ended the plague\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80¢ A drink that forever changed Britain\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a regular consumer, Perrio is similarly keen not to be pinned down â\\x80\\x93 in the same way you might not want to be too limiting in trying to describe a piece of music or art. â\\x80\\x9cProperly cooked ormers have a texture similar to squid, octopus or cuttlefish,â\\x80\\x9d he told me. â\\x80\\x9cThe taste really is very distinctive and not directly comparable to anything else. If pushed, I think the nearest comparison would be razor clams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that ormer hunters obey the bidding of the Moon adds magic to this mollusc. The law only allows them to be gathered on so-called â\\x80\\x9cormering tidesâ\\x80\\x9d, designated as being only on days of a full or new Moon between New Year\\'s Day and the end of April, plus two days following either lunar phase. These are the days when Earth\\'s celestial partner has the biggest effect on tidal ranges â\\x80\\x93 something even more notable on an island with one of the highest tidal ranges in the world, at up to 10m from the highest to lowest tides.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Moon pulls back the ocean to spring minimums, these days offer the best exposure to the rock and crevices that ormers patrol to feed, feasting like gourmands themselves on delicate seaweed fronds. And it is amid Guernsey\\'s low-tide rocks and exposed clumps of seaweed that ormer hunters go in search, using a variety of techniques and tools to reveal the molluscs hiding away here.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are two main methods of ormering, called â\\x80\\x98turningâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98crickingâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d Perrio explained. â\\x80\\x9cTurning involves finding a likely looking patch of loose rocks â\\x80\\x93 ie not attached to the seabed â\\x80\\x93 and searching through them carefully, where the ormer can often be found hiding.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCricking involves carefully searching nooks and crannies that abound in the sides of gullies in the bedrock and under overhanging boulders too big to turn,â\\x80\\x9d he continued. â\\x80\\x9cThis relies on a keen eye for an ormer in a dark and constricted space and being prepared to feel at armâ\\x80\\x99s length under rocky overhangs or in cracks. Many people have favoured areas for this sort of work, with an intimate knowledge of where the best holes are to be found, often having been passed down through the generations of a family.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut finding an ormer doesn\\'t mean your work is done, thanks to the strength with which they can cling to rocks. So, tools come into play. â\\x80\\x9cGatherers are often armed with a traditional ormering hook,â\\x80\\x9d explained Perrio. â\\x80\\x9cThis has a flattened outside edge or end, to assist with prising the ormer away from its refuge. Others rely on some sort of scraper or blade.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n5 interesting ormer facts Ormers take at least three years to reach minimum harvesting size â\\x80\\x93 but live for up to 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrmers have an oxygen-carrying blood pigment based on copper, rather than iron like humans. When oxygen is present, their blood is blue â\\x80\\x93 and colourless when it is absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween July and August, an average female will release about one million eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuernsey bus travel cards are called Ormer Cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrmer shells provide a mother of pearl material highly prized for inlays on everything from 18th-Century English furniture to contemporary musical instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as limiting the â\\x80\\x9cwhenâ\\x80\\x9d, strict laws exist on the â\\x80\\x9chowâ\\x80\\x9d of seeking ormer in Guernsey. You cannot collect an ormer while partially or fully submerged â\\x80\\x93 a hangover from the days when people were once allowed to go diving for ormers in deeper water. And ormers can also only leave the island with explicit permission â\\x80\\x93 just a small supply is exported to seafood markets in Japan, where they can fetch up to Â£150 per kilo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreak any of the rules and you can be fined up to Â£5,000 or face six months in prison. In fact, illicit ormer hunting saw Guernsey police carry out the world\\'s first recorded underwater arrest. It was 1968, and a passer-by noticed a diver bringing up ormer from the sea off Castle Cornet, the 13th-Century harbour citadel guarding the island capital St Peter Port. Police were called, and Constable David Archer donned scuba gear to dive down and apprehend a Mr Kempthorne-Leigh on the seabed â\\x80\\x93 proving the long arm of the law knows no limits when it comes to ormers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many of the world\\'s most interesting foods, people argue about the best way to eat ormers. When celebrated British seafood chef Rick Stein visited the island, he opted for the â\\x80\\x9cslice-it-thin-and-flash-fryâ\\x80\\x9d approach. By contrast, another traditional Guernsey method involves beating the ormer with a wooden mallet, coating it in flour and simmering for eight hours in gravy. The Taste Atlas, meanwhile, lists a 17th-Century casserole combining ormers with pork belly, carrots, shallots, butter and bay leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOrmers need to be cooked either very slowly or very quickly â\\x80\\x93 anything else will result in a culinary disaster,â\\x80\\x9d said Perrio. â\\x80\\x9cFor me, ormers are best eaten as fresh as possible, with stir frying or pan roasting. For a quick sandwich, it\\'s hard to beat ormer strips flash fried to crispy deliciousness in Guernsey butter. Sauteed in local Rocquette cider is another favourite; the alcohol helps tenderise the flesh as well. I do like an old-fashioned slow cook in gravy, but usually can\\'t wait to get stuck in.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also a food where you really earn your culinary payoff, with Perrio admitting that â\\x80\\x9cormering in the winter months is a pretty full-on experience,â\\x80\\x9d citing freezing sea temperatures and the likelihood of a complete soaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many of the world\\'s most interesting foods, people argue about the best way to eat ormers\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other perils too. The slippery and uneven nature of the area you work presents dangers, from falls to potentially trapped extremities. â\\x80\\x9cOther dangers arise from cuts or crushed fingers,â\\x80\\x9d said Perrio. â\\x80\\x9cYou also have to pay careful attention to any building swell, and the incoming tide, which can often seem to rush in much quicker than it went out.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these travails, locals have gathered ormers for centuries â\\x80\\x93 though these molluscs actually date back at least 80 million years to when dinosaurs wandered the shore. It isn\\'t known whether the dinosaurs had a taste for ormer, but they have often provided an important source of sustenance for Guernsey\\'s hungry humans in more recent times. â\\x80\\x9cShore gathering was a way to supplement food supplies when times were hard â\\x80\\x93 ormers were often pickled to preserve them,â\\x80\\x9d said Perrio. They also provided food during the dark years of the island\\'s occupation by German forces from 1940-45, when other survival dishes included Potato Peel Pie.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years have seen legendary ormer harvests. Twenty thousand were reputedly caught on a single day at Perelle Bay in 1841, while during one low tide in 1965, 400 shore gatherers harvested nearly 31,000 ormers. Two years later, an estimated 200,000 ormers were gathered over the entire season.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnsurprisingly, such vast harvests hit ormer numbers. Guernsey imposed the first regulations to limit the harvest as far back as 1876, while ormer â\\x80\\x9cseasonâ\\x80\\x9d was cancelled for three years in a row from 1974 to 1976.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the population remains far below past historical levels, there are now conservation efforts like Project Ormer, which began in 2018 under the auspices of La SociÃ©tÃ© Guernesiaise. Led by marine biologist Laura Bampton, volunteers carry out surveys at low tide, tagging ormers they find with a coded yellow label, fixed to the shell with water-activated glue.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe ormer tagging project has really captured people\\'s imagination â\\x80\\x93 Guernsey people love to talk about ormers,â\\x80\\x9d said Bampton. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\'s great that so many people are interested, and not just in eating them. I hope we can engage more people in learning about our natural environment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is always a buzz around the island when ormer season is approaching and I love watching the gatherers on the beaches at low tide,â\\x80\\x9d added Wendy Pedder from the island\\'s tourist board. â\\x80\\x9cThe long-standing debate among islanders on how best to prepare and eat the ormers is part of Guernsey\\'s culture.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCulinary Roots is a series from BBC Travel connecting to the rare and local foods woven into a placeâ\\x80\\x99s heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

       " 'As well as spending more time in \"Africa\" than in the first film, Coming 2 America also boasts stronger female roles and actors native to the continent, such as Nomzamo Mbatha and Trevor Noah, who were both born in South Africa. Meanwhile the writing team (which this time includes an African-American writer, Black-ish creator Kenya Barris, alongside the original white screenwriters, Barry W Blaustein, and David Sheffield) have obviously tried to give Zamunda more depth by including more details of the African society and how it\\'s governed. Unfortunately, these details paint the kingdom as a regressive one, in which women can\\'t own businesses and male-only royalty is obligatory. \"It sounds as though Zamunda could come to stand in for \\'Africa\\' as a homogenous entity,\" says Dovey, \"And I worry that such ideas will simply translate into the re-confirmation of stereotypes about the African continent that aren\\'t true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMore progressive portrayals\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, Black Panther did deal with these kinds of stereotypes head on, and subvert them, by depicting Wakanda as a progressive kingdom that had strong roles for women in its hierarchy. Wakanda could also not be construed as standing-in for the whole of Africa. Rather, it is a nation whose rulers have cut it off from the rest of the continent, while also pretending to the outside world that it is poor to prevent other countries stealing its stocks of the precious mineral vibranium â\\x80\\x93 another comment on Western expectations. At the same time, unlike Zamunda\\'s Akeem, its ruler king T\\'Challa, aka the titular superhero, understands Western countries and views himself as a global player.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother notable recent attempt to buck stereotypes about Africa was BeyoncÃ©\\'s film Black is King (2020) a visual companion to her soundtrack for the 2019 reboot of The Lion King. The film slickly employs the best talent from many different countries in Africa â\\x80\\x93 including Ghanaian director Blitz Bazawule â\\x80\\x93 to weave together an epic musical celebrating black identity and female empowerment, specifically, and serves as a manifesto for black Americans to recover their heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Black Panther and Black is King are both allegorical fantasies, leading to the question: where can you find inspiring representations of Africa in a real-life setting?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s worth mentioning Queen of Katwe (2016), about the real-life Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi, that featured an all-black cast including Lupita Nyong\\'o and was directed by Indian-American film-maker Mira Nair. Sadly, unlike Black Panther and Black is King, this feelgood movie did not gain much global traction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real answer, of course, is to look to African cinema itself. As Tesfaye says, \"there\\'s a lot of films set in Africa by actual African filmmakers who are portraying their people in their country in such an amazing imaginative, empowering light.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if the profile given to African cinema on an international platform is still paltry compared to what it deserves, then things might be changing with the advent of streaming services that allow for the wider distribution of great new films from the continent such as Ghanaian works The Burial of Kojo (directed by Bazawule) and Azali, Nigeria\\'s The Delivery Boy and Senegal\\'s Atlantique, all on Netflix. Also positive is the broadening of Oscar voting membership to include more African members, including last year, Nigerian-born actor, film director and writer Akin Omotoso and Atlantique\\'s French-Senegalese director Mati Diop. With such steps taking place to amplify African filmmakersâ\\x80\\x99 voices, the hope is that broad-brush misrepresentations of the continent can become a relic of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing 2 America is available on Amazon Prime from 5 March.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove film and TV?

       " \"â\\x80\\x9cIt shows a new model â\\x80\\x93 virtuous, economically viable, and local â\\x80\\x93 and that's important to have,â\\x80\\x9d says founder Pascal Hardy. â\\x80\\x9cI don't think the aim of our urban agriculture is to feed all the city. It's just a contribution. It's an additional offer compared to traditional agriculture.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOther potential contributors sit below our feet. Nearly 600 hectares (1,483 acres) of car parks (roughly an area the size of Gibraltar) sit unused in Paris. Cycloponics is utilising some of that space to produce protein-rich mushrooms and provide space for other innovative food start-ups.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople are looking for good food. They want to know where it comes from. We try to answer that,â\\x80\\x9d says chief executive Jean-Noel Gertz, a thermal engineer. Currently, Cycloponics is able to grow up to 100kg of mushrooms per day in just 38,000sq ft (3,500sq m). That's under 0.1% of the total amount of car park space available in the City of Lights.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it all sounds promising and exciting, there are plenty of challenges to be addressed. Those hurdles include access to land and skilled workers as well as scalability â\\x80\\x93 producing enough food to make these viable enterprises in costly urban centres.\\r\\n\\r\\nTopsoil Innovative Urban Agriculture is an outdoor farm situated on 20,000sq ft (1,850sq m) of to-be-developed land on the outskirts of downtown Victoria, British Columbia. Founder Chris Hildreth says the enterprise is proving â\\x80\\x9cthat you can farm sustainably in a financially viable wayâ\\x80\\x9d. The orderly layout of fabric geotextile planters â\\x80\\x93 holding a variety of crops such as salad greens, radishes, herbs and cucumbers â\\x80\\x93 can be adapted for other unused urban spaces, such as rooftops or gravel plots around schools. â\\x80\\x9cWe can set up a 20,000-square-foot site in less than a week and have it planted and growing. We can take it down in that time too. It all fits into a 20-foot shipping container,â\\x80\\x9d Hildreth says. â\\x80\\x9cEssentially now we have a farm in a box that we can ship to any city and implement in any city.â\\x80\\x9d He's in talks with other Canadian metro areas to purchase the Topsoil model for their own communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAffordability and access are other ongoing worries. Much of the produce cultivated in or near cities is priced at organic food rates, which aren't known to be budget-friendly. As the technology being employed, such as LED grow lights and AI sensors, becomes more affordable, those savings are expected to trickle down to the consumer. Advances in knowledge and equipment could also make it possible â\\x80\\x93 not to mention more environmentally friendly â\\x80\\x93 to efficiently grow the higher biomass crops necessary to nourish future populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you've ever eaten a sugar snap pea the moment after it was picked from the vine or bitten into a ripe farm tomato, you know that they burst (in some cases, quite literally) with flavour and taste a heck of a lot better than those you purchased during your last grocery store run.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat ultra-fresh produce is also more nutritious than what's in your fridge because of the reduced time between when it was gathered and when it reached your table (or mouth). Some vegetables, for example, lose between 10% and 77% of their vitamin C within a week of being harvested, even when kept refrigerated. At urban farms, produce is able to be both packed and sold within a short radius of where it ripened, without the chemicals used to sustain foods for long journeys.\",\n",

       " 'This legacy has been a long time in the making. \"Kenya started early,\" says Mwangi. \"We explored from the 1950s, so we\\'ve had many decades of studies and development and successes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd also failures. \"Our first wells were terrible,\" says Mwangi. \"That was in 1956. Those wells produced low-pressure steam,\" says Karingithi, and at the time, the technology wasn\\'t developed enough to use that steam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Olkaria â\\x80\\x93 Kenya\\'s first geothermal power plant, and the first in Africa â\\x80\\x93 came a quarter of a century later, in 1981. Since the 1950s, KenGen, the parastatal company that operates Olkaria, has drilled 310 wells here in Hell\\'s Gate, 125 of which are still steaming today. Two massive new power plants came online in 2014 and 2015, substantially increasing output.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut their work is far from over. A quarter of Kenya\\'s population still lacks electricity. Blackouts are common, hampering the nation\\'s manufacturing sector and making it hard for students who need to study at night or parents to charge their cell phones. \"We need to add more power so our nation is lighted like the rest of the world,\" says Karingithi.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrillling down\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find the next sources of steam, Mwangi and Karingithi trek as much as 50 kilometers (31 miles) in a single day. They look for sprigs of what they call \"geothermal grass\" â\\x80\\x93 tall and thin, with green and yellow strands, which hint that heat and moisture may be lying underneath. They collect rock samples, test the water and take the temperature of the ground, all of which feeds into their calculations of whether a new well should be drilled in any particular spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you identify a strong location, \"you need investors not to be faint-hearted\", says Karingithi. \"Drilling a well costs $6m [Â£4.3m]. And if you miss, you\\'re sunk.\" That is the major disadvantage of geothermal, he says. \"The capital investment is very high and it puts off many people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many geothermal engineers, the most exciting moment comes when you drill a new well â\\x80\\x93 and strike steam. \"When you drill a well they open the valve and let the fluid discharge into the atmosphere, the noise and the shaking is incredible â\\x80\\x93 it\\'s just absolutely amazing,\" says Newson, of what\\'s called a vertical discharge test. \"The power that comes out of that well â\\x80\\x93 for 20 years â\\x80\\x93 that\\'s so exciting!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Olkaria, wells are tested for about two months to measure their flow rate. Then, the steam is directed either into an on-site mini plant, or through tubes to a larger plant such as Olkaria VI. Because Hell\\'s Gate is home to so much wildlife, in some places the pipes must be lifted several metres above the ground to allow giraffes and other wildlife to pass safely.',\n",
       " \"On a road into New Delhi, countless cars a day speed over tonnes of plastic bags, bottle tops and discarded polystyrene cups. In a single kilometre, a driver covers one tonne of plastic waste. But far from being an unpleasant journey through a sea of litter, this road is smooth and well-maintained â\\x80\\x93 in fact the plastic that each driver passes over isn't visible to the naked eye. It is simply a part of the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis road, stretching from New Delhi to nearby Meerut, was laid using a system developed by Rajagopalan Vasudevan, a professor of chemistry at the Thiagarajar College of Engineering in India, which replaces 10% of a road's bitumen with repurposed plastic waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia has been leading the world in experimenting with plastic-tar roads since the early 2000s. But a growing number of countries are beginning to follow suit. From Ghana to the Netherlands, building plastic into roads and pathways is helping to save carbon emissions, keep plastic from the oceans and landfill, and improve the life-expectancy of the average road.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2040, there is set to be 1.3 billion tonnes of plastic in the environment globally. India alone already generates more than 3.3 million tonnes of plastic a year â\\x80\\x93 which was one of the motivators behind Vasudevan's system for incorporating waste into roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has the benefit of being a very simple process, requiring little high-tech machinery. First, the shredded plastic waste is scattered onto an aggregate of crushed stones and sand before being heated to about 170C â\\x80\\x93 hot enough to melt the waste. The melted plastics then coat the aggregate in a thin layer. Then heated bitumen is added on top, which helps to solidify the aggregate, and the mixture is complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany different types of plastics can be added to the mix: carrier bags, disposable cups, hard-to-recycle multi-layer films and polyethylene and polypropylene foams have all found their way into India's roads, and they don't have to be sorted or cleaned before shredding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as ensuring these plastics don't go to landfill, incinerator or the ocean, there is some evidence that the plastic also helps the road function better. Adding plastic to roads appears to slow their deterioration and minimise potholes. The plastic content improves the surface's flexibility, and after 10 years Vasudevan's earliest plastic roads showed no signs of potholes. Though as many of these roads are still relatively young, their long-term durability remains to be tested.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Vasudevan's calculations, incorporating the waste plastic instead of incinerating it also saves three tonnes of carbon dioxide for every kilometre of road. And there are economic benefits too, with the incorporation of plastic resulting in savings of roughly $670 (Â£480) per kilometre of road.\",\n",
       " 'But alongside the focus on sustainable agriculture, there are other interventions that have raised hackles. Construction workers have mostly finished digging a 35km-long (22 miles) tunnel that will transfer water from the neighboring Little Zab basin to the lake, among other engineering schemes, such as upgraded wastewater facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIHE Delft\\'s Karimi questions whether this strategy will tackle the water-scarcity problem it at its root. \"If you go after things that are investment-oriented, you don\\'t have to work with the communities. You don\\'t have to change behaviour,\" he says. \"But that\\'s not going to work. Demand will just increase to meet supply.\" He and other scientists fear a repeat of some of the unsustainable mistakes that contributed to the lakeâ\\x80\\x99s troubles in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose in the areas where the water will be piped from are furious, too. Campaigners say that Iranian authorities are simply imposing Urmia\\'s problems on others, thrusting additional water poverty onto Iraq, which is already reeling from severe shortages of its own. They are concerned that the water scarcity will be pushed into Kurdish-majority parts of Iran that lack the political support to push back. Conversely, the Iranian Azerbaijan provinces where the lake is located, are among the most politically influential parts of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope for nature?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese days, the lake has swollen to 2,800 sq km (1,080 sq miles), about half its historic size. But how much of this is due to the restoration programme and how much is due to heavy rainfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s no guarantee either that the sandstorms will dissipate or weaken any time soon, no matter how successful Urmia\\'s revival might be. As desertification wreaks havoc, Iran is suffering from swirling walls of dust that germinate well beyond its own borders.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore complicated yet is the political environment in which the lake is being restored. This year is a presidential election year, and the lake restoration has taken on a somewhat partisan complexion. \"Hardliners definitely see this issue of environment and the restoration of the lake as a success story of the Rouhani camp,\" says Negar Mortazavi, a journalist and political analyst based in Washington. \"And they obviously see it as a point of competition that they don\\'t want to champion and they don\\'t want their media to champion it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in this context that the lake has reached a crucial juncture. The lake is currently 3m (10ft) below its target water level. \"So there\\'s quite a ways to go,\" says Ali Mirchi. \"If they follow everything they said in the lake restoration program, and if the conditions are favourable, it\\'s theoretically possible to get to the designated ecological level in a three-year timeframe. But if we hit \\'normal\\' conditions, it could take as long as 16 years.\"',\n",

       " 'Part of doing less is applying fewer agrochemicals to the soil, which if used without expertise can be damaging. â\\x80\\x9cIf you apply fertilisers without knowing the status of your soil, it is really inappropriate and very dangerousâ\\x80\\x9d for the plant, the soil and the environment, according to Rurangwa, who sees some farmers he works with misapplying chemicals. Soil pollution, whose causes include agrochemical use, degrades land, reduces crop yields and sickens humans and animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nRurangwa advocates for using organic fertiliser, and less of it, for instance through more precise microdoses of fertiliser using fertigation (application of fertiliser through irrigation water). Fertiliser briquettes â\\x80\\x93 which can release nutrients more slowly across a much smaller surface area â\\x80\\x93 also have led to higher maize yields and increased nitrogen uptake compared to conventional granular fertiliser in Ghana.\\r\\n\\r\\nBio-organic fertiliser may be especially beneficial. As it contains living microorganisms, such fertiliser can improve microbial balance and ultimately crop quality. These microbial communities do a lot of invisible work in the soil, such as converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use. Rosa Cuevas, a soil scientist at FAOâ\\x80\\x99s Global Soil Partnership, calls biofertiliser â\\x80\\x9can inexpensive and safe alternative to chemical fertilisersâ\\x80\\x9d. For instance, â\\x80\\x9cin the case of nitrogen, biofertilisers have the potential to reduce nitrous oxide emissions (a greenhouse gas around 300 times more powerful than CO2), and contamination of groundwater and coastal ecosystemsâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoating seeds with special microbial cocktails can also help the plants stay robust. FAO provides some farmers with enhanced seeds and fertilisers. But Rurangwa warns, â\\x80\\x9cIt doesnâ\\x80\\x99t replace the improvement of soil health. Even if you have improved seeds, you canâ\\x80\\x99t put improved seeds in poor soil and think youâ\\x80\\x99ll get good results.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, with less disturbance of the soil, Overby says, â\\x80\\x9cThe microbes all have a chance to kind of rebuild the soil pretty quicklyâ\\x80¦ once you start building up that whole underground bunch of living organisms, they do that for you. And different crops exude different types of secretions from the roots.â\\x80\\x9d He credits glomalin, which has been called â\\x80\\x9csoilâ\\x80\\x99s super glueâ\\x80\\x9d, for helping to bind together clusters of soil on his farm. Glomalin is a sticky protein produced by certain fungi in plant roots, which clumps together particles of soil and coats their surface. This clumpier soil can retain water longer and helps to sequester carbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic manipulation can build on the beneficial properties of these microorganisms. For instance, scientists have also been able to isolate certain soil-dwelling bacterial species that produce toxins fatal to insects, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Though genetically modified plants remain controversial in some areas, Cuevas argues that â\\x80\\x9cbiopesticides generally tend to be specific toward their target, do not leave toxic residues, reduce the risk of resistance development in the target species, and produce a lesser overall impact on the environment than traditional problematic chemical pesticidesâ\\x80\\x9d when used inappropriately.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore generally, diversity of plant species and diversity of microbial species feed each other. Lee Farms traditionally grew flax, wheat and barley. But the Overbys have expanded the crop range. The commodity crops now include sunflowers, field peas and oats (the farm has been working with multinational food company General Mills on its regenerative agriculture program).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cover crops include plants like radishes, lentils and buckwheat, although the Overbys donâ\\x80\\x99t always have the time and labour power to plant these. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re continuing to experiment, by planting prairie strips â\\x80\\x93 parcels of varied vegetation alongside rows of crops. And theyâ\\x80\\x99re thinking about planting pollinator strips â\\x80\\x93 lengths of wildflowers alongside crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHaving a lot of diversity, including the cover crops, it built up the soil much faster,â\\x80\\x9d Overby says. It took them about a decade to see the benefits reach the lower layers of the soil, which eventually became more porous and absorptive, so that they didnâ\\x80\\x99t have large wet patches sitting on the ground or running off in wet years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says that embracing varied life forms is essential for farmers like him. â\\x80\\x9cYou can no-till and still degrade your soil. You need to have diversity in it to truly build up your soil over time.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Their talks were likely to focus on inter-faith dialogue and Iraq\\'s Christian minority, long terrorised by Shia armed groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a day of profound symbolism - and perhaps the one that will leave this trip\\'s lasting impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat has the Pope said so far?\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after he was greeted at Baghdad airport by Iraq\\'s Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on Friday, the pontiff called for \"an end to acts of violence and extremism, factions and intolerance\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Iraq has suffered the disastrous effects of wars, the scourge of terrorism and sectarian conflicts,\" he said in a speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The age-old presence of Christians in this land, and their contributions to the life of the nation, constitute a rich heritage that they wish to continue to place at the service of all,\" the Pope added.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said that the country\\'s dwindling Christian community should have a more prominent role as citizens with full rights, freedoms and responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nimage copyright EPA image caption Pope Francis is greeted at the Syro-Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the world\\'s oldest Christian communities has seen its numbers plummet over the last two decades from 1.4 million to about 250,000, less than 1% of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany have fled abroad to escape the violence that has plagued the country since the US-led invasion in 2003 that ousted Saddam Hussein.\\r\\n\\r\\nTens of thousands were also displaced when Islamic State (IS) militants overran northern Iraq in 2014, destroying their historic churches, seizing their property, and giving them the choice to pay a tax, convert, leave or face death.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho are Iraq\\'s Christians?\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople in what is now Iraq embraced Christianity in the 1st Century AD\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the US state department, Christian leaders estimate there are fewer than 250,000 Christians remaining in Iraq, with the largest population - at least 200,000 - living in the Nineveh Plain and Kurdistan Region in the north of the country\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 67% of those are Chaldean Catholics, whose Eastern-rite Church retains its own liturgy and traditions but recognises the authority of the pope in Rome. Another 20% are members of the Assyrian Church of the East, believed to be the oldest in Iraq\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest are Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Armenian Catholic, Armenian Apostolic, as well as Anglican, Evangelical and other Protestants\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the Pope\\'s schedule?\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to security concerns and a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, the Pope will have limited exposure to the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has had two shots of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and his entourage will have been inoculated, but there are fears the trip could become a super-spreader event given the large crowds expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he arrived on Friday, the Pope was seen to have a pronounced limp, suggesting that his sciatica condition continues to bother him.\\r\\n\\r\\nimage copyright EPA image caption The Pope, here with Iraqi President Barham Salih (R), was seen walking with a pronounced limp\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, the pontiff will visit Mosul, where he will say a prayer of suffrage in Church Square for the victims of the war with IS, which left tens of thousands of civilians dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, he is scheduled to lead Mass at a football stadium in Irbil in the north, at which up to 10,000 people are expected to attend.',\n",

       " 'Bessie Smith was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1894. At a time when racial segregation was enforced through the Jim Crow laws, growing up as a black woman in the US south was difficult and dangerous. Employment opportunities for black people were severely limited, amounting pretty much to a choice between manual or domestic labour, or joining a travelling show.\\r\\n\\r\\nBessie was one of eight children, and before her 10th birthday, both her parents and two of her siblings had died. As a result, the children had to earn their own money, and so at just nine years of age, Bessie began busking for nickels on the streets of Chattanooga, accompanied by her brother Andrew on the guitar. In her late teens, she joined her brother Clarence in the Moses Stokes travelling show, taking her out of Chattanooga and into the wide world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough her work in travelling shows, Bessie became acquainted with Ma Rainey, Mother of the Blues. Though Ma didnâ\\x80\\x99t teach Bessie to sing, she almost certainly influenced her performance skills. Legend has it that Ma kidnapped Bessie to take her on the road, a story they enjoyed recounting to each other over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bessie Smith was openly bisexual\\r\\n\\r\\nMa Rainey was a lesbian, and her openness about this may have enabled Bessie to feel more comfortable in exploring her own bisexuality. She first married Earl Love, then Jack Gee, and entered into a common law marriage with Richard Morgan, with whom she remained until her death. But many of her sexual partners were women. She had a long-term companion and confidante, Ruby, who helped cover for her affairs, though there is no evidence the pair engaged in a romantic relationship. Bessie took Ruby on the road with her, teaching her moves so that she could be part of the show as an interval performer.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bessie had an astonishing memory\\r\\n\\r\\nBessie did not have a great level of literacy â\\x80\\x93 understandably, when you think that her childhood was spent singing on the streets of her hometown. Because she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t rely on writing her lyrics down, Bessie committed all 160 of the songs she recorded to memory.',\n",

Those wells produced low-pressure steam,\" says Karingithi, and at the time, the technology wasn\\'t developed enough to use that steam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Olkaria â\\x80\\x93 Kenya\\'s first geothermal power plant, and the first in Africa â\\x80\\x93 came a quarter of a century later, in 1981. Since the 1950s, KenGen, the parastatal company that operates Olkaria, has drilled 310 wells here in Hell\\'s Gate, 125 of which are still steaming today. Two massive new power plants came online in 2014 and 2015, substantially increasing output.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut their work is far from over. A quarter of Kenya\\'s population still lacks electricity. Blackouts are common, hampering the nation\\'s manufacturing sector and making it hard for students who need to study at night or parents to charge their cell phones. \"We need to add more power so our nation is lighted like the rest of the world,\" says Karingithi.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrillling down\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find the next sources of steam, Mwangi and Karingithi trek as much as 50 kilometers (31 miles) in a single day. They look for sprigs of what they call \"geothermal grass\" â\\x80\\x93 tall and thin, with green and yellow strands, which hint that heat and moisture may be lying underneath. They collect rock samples, test the water and take the temperature of the ground, all of which feeds into their calculations of whether a new well should be drilled in any particular spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you identify a strong location, \"you need investors not to be faint-hearted\", says Karingithi. \"Drilling a well costs $6m [Â£4.3m]. And if you miss, you\\'re sunk.\" That is the major disadvantage of geothermal, he says. \"The capital investment is very high and it puts off many people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many geothermal engineers, the most exciting moment comes when you drill a new well â\\x80\\x93 and strike steam. \"When you drill a well they open the valve and let the fluid discharge into the atmosphere, the noise and the shaking is incredible â\\x80\\x93 it\\'s just absolutely amazing,\" says Newson, of what\\'s called a vertical discharge test. \"The power that comes out of that well â\\x80\\x93 for 20 years â\\x80\\x93 that\\'s so exciting!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Olkaria, wells are tested for about two months to measure their flow rate. Then, the steam is directed either into an on-site mini plant, or through tubes to a larger plant such as Olkaria VI. Because Hell\\'s Gate is home to so much wildlife, in some places the pipes must be lifted several metres above the ground to allow giraffes and other wildlife to pass safely.',\n",
       " \"On a road into New Delhi, countless cars a day speed over tonnes of plastic bags, bottle tops and discarded polystyrene cups. In a single kilometre, a driver covers one tonne of plastic waste. But far from being an unpleasant journey through a sea of litter, this road is smooth and well-maintained â\\x80\\x93 in fact the plastic that each driver passes over isn't visible to the naked eye. It is simply a part of the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis road, stretching from New Delhi to nearby Meerut, was laid using a system developed by Rajagopalan Vasudevan, a professor of chemistry at the Thiagarajar College of Engineering in India, which replaces 10% of a road's bitumen with repurposed plastic waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia has been leading the world in experimenting with plastic-tar roads since the early 2000s. But a growing number of countries are beginning to follow suit. From Ghana to the Netherlands, building plastic into roads and pathways is helping to save carbon emissions, keep plastic from the oceans and landfill, and improve the life-expectancy of the average road.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2040, there is set to be 1.3 billion tonnes of plastic in the environment globally. India alone already generates more than 3.3 million tonnes of plastic a year â\\x80\\x93 which was one of the motivators behind Vasudevan's system for incorporating waste into roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has the benefit of being a very simple process, requiring little high-tech machinery. First, the shredded plastic waste is scattered onto an aggregate of crushed stones and sand before being heated to about 170C â\\x80\\x93 hot enough to melt the waste. The melted plastics then coat the aggregate in a thin layer. Then heated bitumen is added on top, which helps to solidify the aggregate, and the mixture is complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany different types of plastics can be added to the mix: carrier bags, disposable cups, hard-to-recycle multi-layer films and polyethylene and polypropylene foams have all found their way into India's roads, and they don't have to be sorted or cleaned before shredding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as ensuring these plastics don't go to landfill, incinerator or the ocean, there is some evidence that the plastic also helps the road function better. Adding plastic to roads appears to slow their deterioration and minimise potholes. The plastic content improves the surface's flexibility, and after 10 years Vasudevan's earliest plastic roads showed no signs of potholes. Though as many of these roads are still relatively young, their long-term durability remains to be tested.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Vasudevan's calculations, incorporating the waste plastic instead of incinerating it also saves three tonnes of carbon dioxide for every kilometre of road.

Construction workers have mostly finished digging a 35km-long (22 miles) tunnel that will transfer water from the neighboring Little Zab basin to the lake, among other engineering schemes, such as upgraded wastewater facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIHE Delft\\'s Karimi questions whether this strategy will tackle the water-scarcity problem it at its root. \"If you go after things that are investment-oriented, you don\\'t have to work with the communities. You don\\'t have to change behaviour,\" he says. \"But that\\'s not going to work. Demand will just increase to meet supply.\" He and other scientists fear a repeat of some of the unsustainable mistakes that contributed to the lakeâ\\x80\\x99s troubles in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose in the areas where the water will be piped from are furious, too. Campaigners say that Iranian authorities are simply imposing Urmia\\'s problems on others, thrusting additional water poverty onto Iraq, which is already reeling from severe shortages of its own. They are concerned that the water scarcity will be pushed into Kurdish-majority parts of Iran that lack the political support to push back. Conversely, the Iranian Azerbaijan provinces where the lake is located, are among the most politically influential parts of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope for nature?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese days, the lake has swollen to 2,800 sq km (1,080 sq miles), about half its historic size. But how much of this is due to the restoration programme and how much is due to heavy rainfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s no guarantee either that the sandstorms will dissipate or weaken any time soon, no matter how successful Urmia\\'s revival might be. As desertification wreaks havoc, Iran is suffering from swirling walls of dust that germinate well beyond its own borders.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore complicated yet is the political environment in which the lake is being restored. This year is a presidential election year, and the lake restoration has taken on a somewhat partisan complexion. \"Hardliners definitely see this issue of environment and the restoration of the lake as a success story of the Rouhani camp,\" says Negar Mortazavi, a journalist and political analyst based in Washington. \"And they obviously see it as a point of competition that they don\\'t want to champion and they don\\'t want their media to champion it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in this context that the lake has reached a crucial juncture. The lake is currently 3m (10ft) below its target water level. \"So there\\'s quite a ways to go,\" says Ali Mirchi. \"If they follow everything they said in the lake restoration program, and if the conditions are favourable, it\\'s theoretically possible to get to the designated ecological level in a three-year timeframe. But if we hit \\'normal\\' conditions, it could take as long as 16 years.\"',\n",

       " 'Few topics have been so endlessly analysed, glorified and dissected as work-life balance.

       " \"Ministers are on a collision course with millions of NHS staff as they insisted the country could not afford a more than 1% pay rise for health workers even as nurses leaders raised the prospect of strike action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Friday insisted the decision to recommend such a small increase was due to an assessment of â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s affordable as a nationâ\\x80\\x9d after the economic toll taken by the coronavirus crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut amid fury from across the public sector, some Conservative MPs expressed fears the government was heading for a humbling U-turn similar to that performed over free school meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked repeatedly at a Downing Street press conference about the plan, announced on Thursday to a furious response from unions, Hancock argued he had secured a good deal for NHS staff, saying he was â\\x80\\x9cvery pleasedâ\\x80\\x9d they had been excluded from a wider public sector pay freeze.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuizzed about his repeated praise for NHS workers over the course of the pandemic, Hancock insisted he could not be more generous: â\\x80\\x9cWe do have issues of the affordability because of the consequences of the pandemic on the public finances, which were set out in the budget this week.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHancock also ruled out the idea of a one-off payment for health staff in recognition of their work in the pandemic, as promised by the Scottish government to its workforce, saying this â\\x80\\x9cisnâ\\x80\\x99t the approach we have chosen to takeâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n01:25 Matt Hancock: nurses' 1% pay rise is 'what we think is affordable' â\\x80\\x93 video\\r\\n\\r\\nResponding to a question from the Nursing Times about a potential staffing crisis if demoralised nurses quit in large numbers, Hancock said his grandmother had been a nurse in Lincolnshire, adding: â\\x80\\x9cI bow to nobody in my admiration for nurses.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has described the 1% figure as pitiful, holding an emergency meeting that agreed to set up a Â£35m fund to support members in the event of a strike.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this does not make industrial action inevitable, it illustrated the strength of feeling among NHS workers, with the British Medical Association and unions representing other staff similarly furious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NHS Confederation, which represents hospital trusts and other organisations, expressed alarm at the prospect of a strike. â\\x80\\x9cThis is not the scenario anyone would want, but this clearly shows the depth of feeling at the RCN,â\\x80\\x9d its chief executive, Danny Mortimer, said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another sign of the PR battle to come, the Unison trade union is organising a public slow handclap for this Thursday evening to protest at the pay offer, mimicking the weekly applause for NHS staff amid the first Covid lockdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Conservative MP said he had already been contacted by constituents angered by the pay decision, which he called â\\x80\\x9can appalling PR move, apart from anything elseâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother backbencher said of the policy: â\\x80\\x9cIt canâ\\x80\\x99t hold,â\\x80\\x9d saying the government should have gone instead for a rise of up to 3% for lower-paid frontline staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nNHS Providers, another membership organisation for hospital trusts and health services, has queried Downing Streetâ\\x80\\x99s insistence that 1% is all that could be afforded, pointing to the fact that a long-term budget plan agreed in 2019 factored in funding for a pay rise of 2.1% in 2021/22.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the calculations were made before the economic damage of Covid, Saffron Cordery, deputy head of NHS Providers said, it would be wrong for the government to be â\\x80\\x9csnatching planned pay rises from the pockets of deserving NHS staffâ\\x80\\x9d to make up the shortfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1% figure, which is for staff across the UK, will now be considered by the Review Body on Doctorsâ\\x80\\x99 and Dentistsâ\\x80\\x99 Remuneration, and also the NHS pay review body, which covers nurses and other staff. Both are expected to report back in May, with final decisions made by Hancock or the relevant devolved administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile pay rises have been more generous in recent years â\\x80\\x93 a 2018 deal gave nurses and other health staff a salary rise of at least 6.5% over three years â\\x80\\x93 this followed a near pay freeze for seven years during the period of austerity politics. Official inflation forecasts also expect this to rise above 1% this year and next.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TUC said on Friday that its analysis showed the cumulative effect was that if the 1% increase goes through for 2021-22, nursesâ\\x80\\x99 pay will be Â£2,500 less than in 2010 when adjusted for inflation, with equivalent falls of Â£3,330 for paramedics and Â£850 for porters. A 1% rise would be â\\x80\\x9ca hammer blow to staff moraleâ\\x80\\x9d, the TUCâ\\x80\\x99s general secretary, Frances Oâ\\x80\\x99Grady, said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDowning Street has also defended the offer as â\\x80\\x9cwhat is affordableâ\\x80\\x9d, while declining to absolutely rule out any eventual increase. â\\x80\\x9cWe will not pre-empt the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies,â\\x80\\x9d Boris Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s spokesman said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Conservative MPs have speculated that the 1% figure could end up being an opening offer, intended to limit any increase, given the RCNâ\\x80\\x99s request for a 12.5% rise. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s better to draw the line closer to the start than to the end of the race, to stop the snowball,â\\x80\\x9d one said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Conservative backbencher said much would depend on the upcoming political battle, with Labour hoping to â\\x80\\x9cturn it into another free school mealsâ\\x80\\x9d, when the government backed down over holiday provision after a campaign led by the footballer Marcus Rashford.\",\n",
       " 'For an agency devoted to secrecy and surveillance, it is an embarrassing slip-up. An inadvertent disclosure on a university document has revealed that MI5 is partly behind what was meant to be a covert bug and drone research project.\\r\\n\\r\\nOstensibly, Imperial Collegeâ\\x80\\x99s research was to create a quadcopter system for charging remote agricultural sensors â\\x80\\x93 but MI5â\\x80\\x99s participation has emerged because somebody involved stated it was the secret second funder of the programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaperwork produced by Imperial initially cited the apparently obscure Government Communications Planning Directorate (GCPD) as a backer â\\x80\\x93 a moniker used in Whitehall as a codename for MI5.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlerted to the slip-up by sister agency MI6, efforts were made to ask Imperial to discreetly remove the reference, but not before it had been drawn to the Guardianâ\\x80\\x99s attention. Since then, the link to MI5 has subsequently been confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntelligence sources say while it can be difficult to place a bug, requiring operatives to carry out installation in disguise, a more serious practical problem is making sure they remain charged over extended periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not impossible to get somebody to a key location to place a listening device, but what is more difficult is to keep sending people back to charge it up â\\x80\\x93 which you might want to keep in place for months or years,â\\x80\\x9d the source added.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh technology has long been part of a spy agencyâ\\x80\\x99s work, although the reality is nothing like as glamorous as some of the equipment provided by Q, the recurring James Bond character, played latterly by a bespectacled Ben Whishaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nMI6 once used a fake rock to hide electronic equipment in Moscow. It was discovered in 2006 by Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s FSB, which gleefully released footage of what it said was a British spy picking up the concealed monitoring device from the side of a road. Several years later, the UK admitted it had been caught spying.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlying a small drone to recharge and extract data from bugs would be difficult to do abroad, but in the UK, where MI5 operates, sources say the theory is that it could be relatively easy to pilot a craft under the cover of darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe researcherâ\\x80\\x99s work was published last September in a peer-reviewed, open-access paper, IEEE Access. It begins by noting: â\\x80\\x9cRemote monitoring under challenging conditions continues to present problems to prospective practitioners.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA solution, the paper suggests, is to take advantage of â\\x80\\x9crecent advances integrating inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, platforms with in situ wireless sensorsâ\\x80\\x9d. That, the authors add, â\\x80\\x9ccan pave the way to delivering long-lasting monitoring systems in remote and extreme environmentsâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nPictures in the IEEE paper show a modified quadcopter, over 50cm wide, which was tested for its ability to land on target in windy outdoors environments. Charging of the monitoring devices was only required every 30 days in a test application, the researchers said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Armstrong, director of communications at the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, commented: â\\x80\\x9cThe security applications of this technology are not in any doubt â\\x80\\x93 this form of system is in active use in some of the most sensitive intelligence missions undertaken by the British state.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thinktank also raised concerns that one of the members of the research team had left the UK and now worked for Chinese engineering giant Huawei in Shenzen, near Hong Kong in mainland China. Armstrong accused MI5 of making a misjudgment in its vetting procedures for the project and displaying â\\x80\\x9ca wider naivetyâ\\x80\\x9d over China.\\r\\n\\r\\nMI5, however, is not understood to have security concerns, while Imperial insiders said there was â\\x80\\x9cno technology leakâ\\x80\\x9d because the results of its research are published â\\x80\\x93 even if the full extent of its potential applications is not spelled out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is not clear is whether MI5 has taken any of the development work forward by adding bespoke capabilities in-house. Imperial College said that â\\x80\\x9cthis project with agricultural applications is published and open to anyoneâ\\x80\\x9d and that â\\x80\\x9cnone of our research is classifiedâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritainâ\\x80\\x99s spy agencies often use codenames on public documents to conceal the involvement of their work. MI6 uses the cover name Government Communications Bureau, once revealed on an energy efficiency certificate for its distinctive headquarters in Vauxhall, south London.

Now, the Sussexes and Winfrey are neighbors in a seaside Santa Barbara county enclave, home to a slew of Hollywood heavyweights, and they even exchanged Christmas presents.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete what Thompson called â\\x80\\x9ca ritualistic transitionâ\\x80\\x9d, the couple will â\\x80\\x9cconfront stepping into the new territory and stepping out of the oldâ\\x80\\x9d. And itâ\\x80\\x99s Winfrey, as she has for decades with countless others, who will be a ceremonial guide, and is expected to bring her loyal audience of millions to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA primetime Oprah interview maybe one of the really symbolic moments of arrival because Oprah is, and always was, always about reinvention,â\\x80\\x9d Thompson added.\\r\\n\\r\\n00:40 Meghan tells Oprah it's 'really liberating' to 'speak for yourself' â\\x80\\x93 video\\r\\n\\r\\nThough a recent Morning Consult poll found that the Queen remains the favorite royal among Americans, with Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, second, Harry and Meghan rank highly, coming third and fourth respectively. But whether they will draw audiences to rival those of the Netflix drama The Crown (seen by 78 million households worldwide, according to the streaming service) remains to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuckingham Palace announced last month that Harry and Meghan would not be returning as working members of the royal family following their 12-month trial separation. The statement meant the couple, and their son Archie, would formally â\\x80\\x93 and finally â\\x80\\x93 step away from royal duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Borkowski, a British brand expert, believes this formalized break could give the couple the freedom they need to complete their re-invention or rebranding in more contemporary terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe point is, they are on a journey and much depends on what momentum they get around them,â\\x80\\x9d Borkowski says. â\\x80\\x9cThis is about where she could be in 15 or 20 years time. Could she have a shot at the presidency? I think she probably could.â\\x80\\x9d\",\n",

       " 'Cyprusâ\\x80\\x99s decision to allow vaccinated Britons entry to the country ahead of the rest of the EU was spurred by the blocâ\\x80\\x99s reluctance to take a decisive stance on Covid-19 immunity certificates, a tourism minister has said.\\r\\n\\r\\nExplaining why the country had broken ranks with other EU members by deciding to admit Britons with the certificate from 1 May, Savvas Perdios told the Guardian that visitors, holidaymakers, and the travel industry all â\\x80\\x9cneeded clarityâ\\x80\\x9d, which the step sought to deliver.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe felt that we had to announce it because we donâ\\x80\\x99t know when an agreement will be reached at a European level,â\\x80\\x9d Perdios said. â\\x80\\x9cFor people who are going to be travelling here, we wanted to provide certainty that Cyprus is going to be ready to welcome them. Travel planning requires certainty.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe move, unveiled late on Thursday, came as the bloc struggled to forge a united front on â\\x80\\x9cvaccine passportsâ\\x80\\x9d first proposed by Greece in January. Tourist-reliant countries on Europeâ\\x80\\x99s south-east fringe appear increasingly willing to act independently as they desperately seek to salvage industries battered by the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nCyprus draws 13% of its national income from tourism, and 10% of its workforce is employed in the sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the pandemic, Britons far surpassed all other arrivals to the former British colony, ethnically split between Greeks in the south and Turks in the north since 1974.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 1.3 million UK tourists visited the south in 2019 â\\x80\\x93 almost twice the local population. As in Greece, which had attracted record numbers before the pandemic but suffered a massive drop last year, tourism in Cyprus was pummelled in 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, Nicosia and Athens reached a deal with Israel allowing citizens with Covid-19 vaccination certificates to travel unimpeded between the three countries. The accord is expected to come into effect at the end of this month.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerdios said Anglo-Cypriot teams were already in talks to discuss the details of how vaccine passports would work as part of a similar bilateral agreement with the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a matter of technicalities as to what the certificate will look like. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll have further meetings in the next few days and weeks to finalise everything,â\\x80\\x9d he said, emphasising that Greek Cypriot authorities were prepared to be flexible about what format the document eventually took. â\\x80\\x9cWe will use whatever the UK government wants us to use. It is the UK that will decide whether the certificate will be digital or whether it will be a certificate from a GP â\\x80¦ We will not be asking to have a vaccine certificate based on our design.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBookings to the island have risen since Boris Johnson announced his governmentâ\\x80\\x99s roadmap out of Englandâ\\x80\\x99s third national lockdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough 17 May was set as the earliest possible date for the resumption of international travel by the British leader, Perdios said Nicosia had also decided to include the UK in quarantine-free travel as of next month. Since the emergence of Covid-19 variants, all non-essential travel out of the UK has been banned, with rare exceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with Greek Cypriot authorities mindful of the islandâ\\x80\\x99s large community of British expatriates, Perdios said anyone arriving from the UK as of 1 April would be given special dispensation in line with restrictions recently lifted for incomers from the EU. This week the island began accepting travellers based on a country categorisation system with colour codes defining the epidemiological caseload of each member state.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo matter which category [Britain] is in, people flying in from the UK will not be placed in quarantine unless they test positive and have to be put into isolation. We basically guarantee quarantine-free travel from the UK as from 1 April,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWhat comes into effect on top of that on May 1 is that those who have a vaccine certificate will be facilitated so they do not have to do a test as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCyprus has said that inoculated visitors will have to have had two jabs, both approved by the European Medicines Agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nTourists who contract the virus in the country will continue to be covered by the Cypriot government, with the state picking up â\\x80\\x9call costsâ\\x80\\x9d for them and their dependants in a repeat of a scheme initiated last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut we are not only opening up to vaccinated travellers,â\\x80\\x9d Perdios added. â\\x80\\x9cEverybody will be allowed to travel here, with or without certificates, and of course the date of travel depends on the UK government and when it decides to allow outbound travel.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'The number of people with Covid-19 continued to fall in households across the UK at the end of February, though the picture was uncertain in some parts of England, data showed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that about one in 220 people in private households in England had coronavirus between 21 and 27 February, the equivalent of 248,100 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure was down from about one in 145, or 373,700 people, for the period 13-19 February, and was the lowest figure since the week to 1 October, when it was one in 240.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar declines were seen in all UK nations, with the ONS estimating one in 335, or 15,600 people, infected in Scotland; one in 285 or 10,600 in Wales; and one in 325, or 5,700 cases, in Northern Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe falls demonstrate that the lockdown is working, a trend bolstered by projections from Sage modellers released on Friday, which suggest deaths in England could drop to fewer than 100 a day by the end of March.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut government science advisers say levels of coronavirus are still high in the UK, with the number of cases believed to be greater than at any time between May and late September last year. In the week to 25 August 2020, about one in 2,000 people had the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ONS said the percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the latest figures had decreased in all regions except for north-east England, the east Midlands and eastern England, where it said the trend was uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth-east England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 February â\\x80\\x93 about one in 150 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe West Midlands had the next highest estimate at one in 160, while the figure was one in 185 for the east Midlands; one in 190 for north-west England; one in 195 for London; one in 225 for Yorkshire and the Humber; one in 260 for eastern England; one in 340 for south-east England and one in 365 for south-west England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ONS data is based on swab tests from 684,875 people in the UK, regardless of whether they had symptoms, and does not include hospitals and care homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther figures released on Friday show that the R number â\\x80\\x93 how many people an infected person passes the virus to â\\x80\\x93 and the growth rate of the epidemic have changed little since last week. According to the Department of Health and Sage, the R number is 0.7 to 0.9 across the UK, up marginally from 0.6 to 0.9 last week. If R rises above 1, as may happen when schools reopen, case numbers will start to rise again. Meanwhile, the epidemic is estimated to be shrinking at between 3 and 5% a day across the UK, a change from 2 to 6% a day last week.\\r\\n\\r\\nProf John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who sits on Sage, said the focus may soon shift away from the R number as it becomes less relevant to pressure on the NHS. Government policy has previously centred on maintaining R below 1, because when cases rise, so do hospital admissions and deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that the era of the R number is coming to an end,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe recently published roadmap has this as one of its four tests: â\\x80\\x98infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHSâ\\x80\\x99. That is, an increase in infections may be tolerated as long as it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t put undue pressure on hospital services.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe idea is that even if infection rates increase the numbers of new hospitalisations will hopefully remain low, as the highest risk groups have been vaccinated. The growth or decline in hospitalisations is now critical, not the overall R number.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Between June and September last year, Pope rushed to A&E three times with terrifying episodes that she describes as being â\\x80\\x9clike a heart attackâ\\x80\\x9d.

At the time, she says, â\\x80\\x9cthe narrative was of not being believedâ\\x80\\x9d and patients were having to become experts in their own condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile awareness among doctors has improved, she says, in many places there is still nowhere for them to refer patients for specialist help. â\\x80\\x9cSo actually, it is difficult for a GP, if they make a diagnosis of long Covid, but they then [have to] say: â\\x80\\x98I am not sure where to refer you to.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if everyone were able to get a diagnosis and referral, this is an enormous problem, the scale of which we are only beginning to comprehend, she says.

       " 'PM will have anxious few weeks before Covid impact of return to classrooms in England is known\\r\\n\\r\\nPubs may not open until April, nightclubs until June, but for millions of frazzled parents across England, Monday will be the most eagerly awaited landmark on the long road back to normal life, when schools reopen their doors to all pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, for Boris Johnson it will be the start of an anxious few weeks as the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s health experts monitor the impact of the â\\x80\\x9cbig bangâ\\x80\\x9d reopening on Covid infection rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an open letter in January, the prime minister declared himself â\\x80\\x9cin aweâ\\x80\\x9d of parents juggling home schooling with jobs and household chores. That is why No 10 made a deliberate decision to put the return to school at the top of the list of priorities for reopening, amid intense pressure from Tory backbenchers concerned about the impact on childrenâ\\x80\\x99s education and wellbeing, as well as parentsâ\\x80\\x99 ability to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson rejected calls from ministers including the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to send pupils back after the February half-term and instead set the date of 8 March â\\x80\\x93 three weeks after the top four priority groups had received their first vaccine dose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speed and scale of the inoculations â\\x80\\x93 more than 20 million people have had their first jab so far â\\x80\\x93 has given ministers more political wriggle room than they might have hoped for.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd during the extra fortnight of Zoom lessons around the kitchen table the number of new cases dropped further â\\x80\\x93 there were 6,573 new case on Thursday, fewer than half the number two weeks ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut some experts are still wary about the â\\x80\\x9cbig bangâ\\x80\\x9d reopening, and government insiders remain acutely conscious that the return to school will mean a big change in the number of social connections made by many households.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe feel like weâ\\x80\\x99re definitely confident on going ahead: infections are now at a lower rate and weâ\\x80\\x99ve vaccinated a lot more people â\\x80\\x93 but of course we acknowledge that thereâ\\x80\\x99s likely to be some impact on cases: our challenge is to manage that,â\\x80\\x9d said a No 10 source.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its 11 February meeting, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) reaffirmed its expectation that schools reopening would increase the reproduction number of the disease, known as R, by 10%-50% â\\x80\\x93 not just because of children mixing, but parents meeting at the school gates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department for Education hopes that the regular testing of teachers, school support staff and secondary school pupils, as well as the availability of at-home kits for the parents of school-age children, will help to reduce the risk of large-scale outbreaks by identifying asymptomatic cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also more confident that with the virus less prevalent it will be easier to track and control fresh outbreaks, in a way that became all but impossible as the second wave took hold in the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have very, very detailed, quite granular levels of data â\\x80\\x93 and because the prevalence is lower, there is less noise,â\\x80\\x9d said a Department of Health and Social Care source.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabour has also backed the wider reopening. â\\x80\\x9cWe have always said that the best place for children to be is in schools: best for their learning and best for their social and emotional wellbeing,â\\x80\\x9d said the shadow education secretary, Kate Green.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she said she would still like to see more support given to schools to make the changes necessary to create a Covid-safe environment, such as testing, spacing pupils out and improving ventilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTeachers and heads are still saying the government are not being forthcoming with help,â\\x80\\x9d she said, reiterating Labourâ\\x80\\x99s call for â\\x80\\x9cNightingale classroomsâ\\x80\\x9d to allow children to be taught safely without crowding.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnions representing teachers and other education staff issued a joint statement on Friday urging the government to review the impact of reopening over the Easter break. â\\x80\\x9cThe timing of the current reopening offers an opportunity to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the early data findings during the Easter holidays and to act on this decisively if there are any indications of a spike in infections in any part of the country,â\\x80\\x9d they said.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson has promised to wait five weeks before proceeding to the next stage of his roadmap â\\x80\\x93 four weeks to review the data, plus a weekâ\\x80\\x99s notice to announce any changes to the plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeline How England\\'s Covid lockdown will be lifted Show Hide Step 1, part 1 All pupils and college students return fully. People can meet one other person outside, not just for exercise. Care home residents can receive one regular, named visitor. The â\\x80\\x9cstay at homeâ\\x80\\x9d order will otherwise stay in place. Step 1, part 2 Outdoor gatherings allowed of up to six people, or two households if this is larger, not just in parks but also gardens. Outdoor sport for children and adults will be allowed. The official stay at home order will end, but people will be encouraged to stay local. People will still be asked to work from home where possible, with no overseas travel allowed beyond the current small number of exceptions. Step 2 The official outline plan states that the next steps will rely on data, and the dates given mean \"no earlier than\". In step two, there will be a reopening of non-essential retail, hair and nail salons, and public buildings such as libraries and museums. Most outdoor venues can open, including pubs and restaurants but only for outdoor tables and beer gardens. Customers will have to be seated but there will be no need to have a meal with alcohol. Also reopening will be settings such as zoos and theme parks. However, social contact rules will apply here, so no indoor mixing between households and limits on outdoor mixing. Indoor leisure facilities such as gyms and pools can also open but again people can only go alone or with their own household. Reopening of holiday lets with no shared facilities, but only for one household. Funerals can have up to 30 attendees, while weddings, receptions and wakes can have 15. Step 3 Again with the caveat \"no earlier than 17 May\", depending on data, vaccination levels and current transmission rates. Step 3 entails that most mixing rules are lifted outdoors, with a limit of 30 people meeting in parks or gardens. Indoor mixing will be allowed, up to six people or, if it is more people, two households. Indoor venues such as the inside of pubs and restaurants, hotels and B&Bs, play centres, cinemas and group exercise classes will reopen. The new indoor and outdoor mixing limits will remain for pubs and other hospitality venues. For sport, indoor venues can have up to 1,000 spectators or half capacity, whichever is lower; outdoors the limit will be 4,000 people or half capacity, whichever is lower. Very large outdoor seated venues, such as big football stadiums, where crowds can be spread out, will have a limit of 10,000 people, or a quarter full, whichever is fewer. Weddings will be allowed a limit of 30 people, with other events such as christenings and barmitzvahs also permitted. This will be the earliest date at which international holidays could resume, subject to a separate review. Step 4 No earlier than 21 June, all legal limits will be removed on mixing, and the last sectors to remain closed, such as nightclubs, will reopen. Large events can take place. Peter Walker Political correspondent\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the education select committee, has been among the backbenchers pressing Johnson to open schools as soon as possible. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m very happy that the kids are going back,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis main concern is that the testing regime is made to work properly â\\x80\\x93 and that the thinking behind new guidance on mask-wearing in secondary schools is made clear to parents and students.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think the mask policy has got to be clarified,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI think what parents want is an open letter from the chief medical officer, saying why he thinks masks are necessary in the classroom, and how long theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to be needed.â\\x80\\x9d He warned of â\\x80\\x9cmask anarchyâ\\x80\\x9d if the policy was not made clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamson, widely tipped for the chop in a summer reshuffle, has been visiting schools this week highlighting the intensive preparations taking place, and the apparent enthusiasm of teachers to welcome their pupils back.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the return goes without a hitch, the political credit will be banked not by Williamson but by Johnson, already basking in the glow of the successful vaccine deployment, which helped him extend his lead over Labour to 13 points in a YouGov opinion poll this week.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut every step in the roadmap is an epidemiological gamble â\\x80\\x93 and this one is the riskiest of all.',\n",

Not only to support and comfort her mum, Debra, but also to care for her dad, John, 70, who lives alone and had a mild stroke in the first lockdown. When travel restrictions allowed, Myers managed to fly home to spend a few days with her dad. But two days before she was due to visit her mum, the second national lockdown was announced.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll Iâ\\x80\\x99ve wanted is to give my mum a hug and sit with endless cups of tea while reminiscing and sharing in our grief,â\\x80\\x9d she says.

Before the pandemic, his 64-year-old mum Mabel, stepdad Trevor and two sisters â\\x80\\x93 Jayne and Keri â\\x80\\x93 would travel from Dungannon in Northern Ireland to visit him, his partner, Lindsay, and their three children in Strathaven, Scotland, about every six weeks. They would spend long weekends and Christmases together, and have joint summer holidays.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ve been a huge part of my childrenâ\\x80\\x99s lives ever since they were born,â\\x80\\x9d says Busby, 39.

But the last time they were all together was January 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe children really miss the family [in Northern Ireland],â\\x80\\x9d says Busby. Each time they are given a school project to write about what they want to do when restrictions are lifted, Busbyâ\\x80\\x99s children â\\x80\\x93 Ruaraidh, 10, Angus, seven, and Mairi, five â\\x80\\x93 write that they want to visit granny. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s always the same thing,â\\x80\\x9d he adds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mum is also becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of contact.

They moved there for work in 2015 while Niamh stayed in Glasgow to attend university.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s heartbreaking to acknowledge Iâ\\x80\\x99ve not seen them in over a year now,â\\x80\\x9d says Niamh, who has been working odd jobs since she graduated last year with a degree in English language and linguistics. This past Christmas â\\x80\\x93 which marked a year since they were last together â\\x80\\x93 was especially difficult. â\\x80\\x9cIt was quite an emotional time for all of us,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cI try not to think about how long it will be until I can see them again, especially considering the much slower rate of vaccination in the States.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Niamh has Skype calls with her parents at least once a week and has other family members nearby, the separation has made her feel lonely. The first lockdown was especially isolating, she says, as many of her friends, and one of her flatmates, went home to stay with their families. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d see stuff on social media of everyone in their childhood homes, living with their parents and their childhood pets.

Photograph: Ashley Oostdyck/Stories by Ash\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last time 31-year old Emma MacKenzie saw her family in Australia, the main thing on their minds was not the coronavirus pandemic but the devastating bushfires. It was November 2019, and friends and family were travelling to Byron Bay from all over the world to attend MacKenzieâ\\x80\\x99s wedding to her now husband, Albert. â\\x80\\x9cWe were actually more worried that people wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t get into Australia because of the fires,â\\x80\\x9d she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more than a year later, the main thing stopping MacKenzie, who works in communications and lives in Berlin, from returning home to Brisbane is the â\\x80\\x9cinordinately expensiveâ\\x80\\x9d cost of flights and hotel quarantine. She was offered a repatriation flight by the Australian government at the start of the pandemic but decided to stay in Germany, where she has lived for seven years. Not only did she have a job and a home to consider but, as a German national, Albert would not have been able to go with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could have been separated from my husband indefinitely,â\\x80\\x9d says MacKenzie. â\\x80\\x9cMy gut told me to stay here and see how things play out.â\\x80\\x9d It was a difficult decision, and one which she has been â\\x80\\x9cgoing back and forthâ\\x80\\x9d on ever since, especially seeing the level of freedom in Australia at the moment. â\\x80\\x9cThere are points of envy,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cWe could have had such a different life this last year â\\x80\\x93 one that might not have been as traumatic.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Kelly Macdonaldâ\\x80\\x99s roles are typically quiet, fraught with internal conflict and entailing journeys that are more reflective than active. As a grieving mother in The Child In Time, a gangsterâ\\x80\\x99s wife in Boardwalk Empire and the titular role in The Girl In The Cafe, the 45-year-old has, over the last 25 years, become known for the kind of thoughtful performances signified by the image of a woman staring out of a window. All of which makes our encounter today doubly surprising; that Macdonald, appearing via Zoom from her home in Glasgow, is here to talk about Line Of Duty, possibly the least reflective TV show ever made. And that she is a complete hoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer role in Line Of Duty has, over the course of the showâ\\x80\\x99s six seasons, become a coveted one in British telly â\\x80\\x93 that of the guest star brought on as a no-good cop to be investigated by AC-12, the showâ\\x80\\x99s now iconic anti-corruption unit. (Previous incumbents in the just-how-bent-is-she role include Keeley Hawes and Thandie Newton.) Line Of Dutyâ\\x80\\x99s twists are legendary, and the embargos fierce, and, following the rollercoaster of season five â\\x80\\x93 in which we grappled, briefly, with the possibility that Supt Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) himself was bent â\\x80\\x93 we meet Macdonald in season six as DCI Jo Davidson, getting stuck into a case. And that is pretty much all, ahead of transmission, the BBC will permit either of us to reveal, which makes Macdonald crack up every time she thinks of it. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s hilarious that they sent me a list of things Iâ\\x80\\x99m not to talk about, when I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember any of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonald in the just-how-bent-is-she role in season six of Line Of Duty. Photograph: BBC/World Productions\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is partly down to scattiness. A day before the interview, Macdonald turned up an hour early to the Guardian photoshoot on the shores of Loch Lomond. She forgets words, dates, times. She has been known to rock up to auditions having failed entirely to study the script. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m horrible,â\\x80\\x9d she says, cheerful in a chunky knit sweater, which is, she says, one notch up from her customary lockdown hoodie. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m just rubbish at reading the emails.â\\x80\\x9d At home, sheâ\\x80\\x99ll look up from whatever sheâ\\x80\\x99s doing and catch her sons, Theodore, eight, and, in particular, Freddie, 12, regarding her with incredulity. â\\x80\\x9cMy son sits over there, plugged in, on his iPad, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m on the phone, and I just see the way he looks at me; I still remember [at his age] thinking my mum was a fool, such a fool, about technology.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Trainspotting shoot, everyone was drinking. It was like high school. We were just hanging out at the pub\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is there in her performances, this guileless good humour. Macdonald once described acting as â\\x80\\x9cnot brain surgeryâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 not a view shared by most actors at her level â\\x80\\x93 a delight in the absurdity of it all that has been visible onscreen since her first, explosive role as Diane in Trainspotting. That was released in 1996, when Macdonald turned 20, and, as it turned out, Diane â\\x80\\x93 brazen, impulsive, outrageous â\\x80\\x93 was atypical of the work that would follow. The women she plays tend to be strong, but not loud; simmering with ambition â\\x80\\x93 as in Boardwalk Empire, in which her character, Margaret, crawls out from the shadow of her mob boss husband (played by Steve Buscemi) to eventually run her own show; or Mary, Maggie Smithâ\\x80\\x99s shrewd maid in Robert Altmanâ\\x80\\x99s 2001 film Gosford Park. In the last few years, Macdonald has appeared in shows such as Black Mirror (Hated In The Nation), alongside John Hannah in the TV series The Victim, and as Sarah, a loner cop, in Giri/Haji, the British-Japanese thriller. Most affectingly, she played Julie in The Child in Time, the 2017 movie adaptation of Ian McEwanâ\\x80\\x99s novel, opposite Benedict Cumberbatch, as a couple whose child is abducted. In most of these projects, Macdonald is the still centre of the action, a performer whose powers lie in her ability to communicate volumes with minimal movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting: â\\x80\\x98Ewan had done a lot of sex scenes and made me feel as comfortable as I could be.â\\x80\\x99 Photograph: Prod DB/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nLine Of Duty is a different beast altogether, although in keeping with Macdonaldâ\\x80\\x99s tendency to arrive late to things â\\x80\\x93 â\\x80\\x9cI mean, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve still not seen The Sopranosâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 she had no idea about the show when she signed up for the role. She knew it was popular, of course, so that when the call came through while she was on a train from London to Glasgow, she was excited to have won the job. (She wanted to scream, but was on her own and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t.) The jubilation quickly faded. â\\x80\\x9cThey sent the first episode while I was on the train. And I managed to download it and immediately got freaked out at the intensity.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI love Line Of Duty. I love the fact itâ\\x80\\x99s all business, with no time to spare on the coppersâ\\x80\\x99 personal lives. I love the jargon. In any given exchange, it is perfectly permissible for one character to turn to another and say, â\\x80\\x9c37, 45, status six,â\\x80\\x9d receive the reply â\\x80\\x9c10, 37, active messageâ\\x80\\x9d, and round it all off with a spectrographic analysis giving a 99.5% probability of accuracy. I love DC Arnottâ\\x80\\x99s odd diction, and Kate Flemingâ\\x80\\x99s knitwear, and I love Hastingsâ\\x80\\x99 flawed heroism. I have, over the course of five seasons, loved every corrupt guest star.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonald, in the first instance, was not inclined to fall in love; she was too busy wondering how she was going to learn all this stuff. â\\x80\\x9cIt was just a very dense script, lots of dialogue â\\x80\\x93 Iâ\\x80\\x99d never done as much dialogue on any job. The jobs Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done have been emotional dialogue and this was a different thing â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s information. My first thought was that this would be really challenging, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s probably a good thing, but I did have to think about it. I know one person who had been offered a role in some season and turned it down because of the mentalâ\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x9d The sheer volume of details? â\\x80\\x9cYeah.â\\x80\\x9d To try to inspire herself, Macdonald went back to the beginning and started watching the show, only to freak herself out even more. She abandoned it in season four, â\\x80\\x9cbecause it started getting close to the beginning of filming and I really started panicking. And Thandie was being so good!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Maggie Smithâ\\x80\\x99s maid in Gosford Park. Photograph: Allstar\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonald has always had nerves. Itâ\\x80\\x99s mystifying to her how any actor might not. She characterises herself as a quietish person who in the early days of a shoot finds simply being in a room with strangers quite stressful. No one in her family worked in the arts. She was born in Glasgow, before her parents moved to Aberdeen; after they divorced, she was raised by her mum, who worked in sales. It was serendipity that she got cast in Trainspotting: she picked up a flyer advertising an open audition and turned up on a whim. She had done some youth theatre and remembers, very vividly, being in the cinema watching the 1989 movie The Delinquents. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Kylie Minogue was in it, and all I could think was, â\\x80\\x98I could do that, I could do that!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d But that was the extent of her experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was in Brave, I was like, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m a Disney princess â\\x80\\x93 whoa, what?â\\x80\\x99 Being a guest lead in Line Of Duty is like that\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking back, says Macdonald, that Trainspotting shoot seems like prehistoric times â\\x80\\x93 not least because they were drunk a lot of the time; she canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine a film set being as louche as that these days. â\\x80\\x9cI thought it was OK because everyone else was [drinking]. It was like high school, you just try to fit in.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWait, where did they drink? â\\x80\\x9cWe were just hanging out at the pub. The green room was a little caravan that we were all supposed to sit in. And the sensible people would sit, and the others would go to the local pub.â\\x80\\x9d When she filmed the famous club scene where her character meets Ewan McGregorâ\\x80\\x99s for the first time, Macdonald had been drinking all day. â\\x80\\x9cBy the time it came to me doing the talky bit, I was already hungover.â\\x80\\x9d Sheâ\\x80\\x99s proud of the movie and has a poster of it up on her wall, but says, seemingly reflexively, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve not watched it since the premiere, so I have no idea. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite bad in it, actually.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonald has been lucky with directors. Danny Boyle was sensitive to her inexperience, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s never had a truly awful time on set. â\\x80\\x9cOh God, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been so lucky. A lot of it is being in the right place at the right time. Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite good at not working for the sake of working, although sometimes it would have benefited me fiscally. But if my instincts say itâ\\x80\\x99s not for me, then I go with that. Because the couple of jobs that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve not really been right for, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had that feeling, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve generally been correct.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWould it be rude to say what they are?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes. I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say. And you live and learn, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith her ex-husband, Travis bassist Dougie Payne, in 2011. Photograph: Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were lean years, or as she puts it, â\\x80\\x9cI had long periods of time off, and would start thinking of all kinds of other careers, and would get jigsaws out.â\\x80\\x9d At the start of her career, work was so â\\x80\\x9csuper sporadicâ\\x80\\x9d, she says, that â\\x80\\x9cI had to move back home. And when I got together with my ex, he had to help me out at times.â\\x80\\x9d (Her ex-husband is Dougie Payne, the bassist in the Scottish band Travis. The pair were married for 14 years until 2017, and share custody of their two boys.) Not long after Trainspotting came out and became a huge hit, Macdonald was called in for an audition for The Matrix, the 1999 blockbuster starring Keanu Reeves. She rocked up having barely glanced at the script, something that still makes her laugh. â\\x80\\x9cI was just an idiot, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no otherâ\\x80¦ I probably attempted a few pages and thought, â\\x80\\x98What? I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand: Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just wing it.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWasnâ\\x80\\x99t that mentality cancelled by her nerves?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, stupidity is just stupidity â\\x80\\x93 the nerves donâ\\x80\\x99t affect it.â\\x80\\x9d She laughs. â\\x80\\x9cBut I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t right for it, anyway. I was too young. No.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Macdonald appeared in the Joe Wright-directed film version of Anna Karenina, alongside Keira Knightley â\\x80\\x93 she interrupts as I mention this to tell me, excitedly, that Vicky McClure, who plays DI Fleming in Line Of Duty, was also in the movie, although â\\x80\\x9cshe thinks she might have been cut out of it, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, anyway, neither of us have seen itâ\\x80\\x9d. In a recent interview, Knightley expressed doubt that she would ever film a sex scene with a male director again. Macdonald says she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t wholly identify with this, not for lack of sympathy, nor because her experience of shooting sex scenes has been particularly good, but as a matter, perhaps, of expectation. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve worked with very few female directors. There was a female director on Line Of Duty, which was nice. But I think Iâ\\x80\\x99m beyond sex scenes at this point. I just play detectives now. My experiences have been, I mean, theyâ\\x80\\x99re horrible, theyâ\\x80\\x99re uncomfortable, but you just get on with it. You think, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to be here, and then itâ\\x80\\x99ll be over.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Line Of Duty, you get a soggy sandwich. On American productions thereâ\\x80\\x99s a food table laid out all day long\\r\\n\\r\\nBut have you ever had to assert yourself and push back against something worse, or more abusive, than the discomfort of being naked in front of strangers? â\\x80\\x9cNo. Iâ\\x80\\x99m unusual, possibly, in that the people Iâ\\x80\\x99ve worked with have thought about it beforehand, and are thinking about it at the time, so itâ\\x80\\x99s as comfortable as it can be. Hopefully, thereâ\\x80\\x99s not too many people in the room. You donâ\\x80\\x99t want it to get too busy.â\\x80\\x9d Trainspotting, oddly, was probably the biggest sex scene sheâ\\x80\\x99s shot. â\\x80\\x9cEwan had done a lot of sex scenes before that, and he was so sweet to me and talked me through it, and made me feel as comfortable as I could be,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cI know the thing now is to have people [intimacy coaches] with you and talk you through it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never done that. Itâ\\x80\\x99s always been, make it up and hope itâ\\x80\\x99s not too embarrassing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe didnâ\\x80\\x99t audition for Boardwalk Empire. She was called in by Martin Scorsese, who directed early episodes and who, sheâ\\x80\\x99s convinced, was labouring under the misapprehension that, like her character, Margaret, she was Irish. It got to the point, says Macdonald, that after winning the role she rang her agent in a panic. â\\x80\\x9cI was like, â\\x80\\x98You need to let them know I need to do work on the accent! Because Iâ\\x80\\x99m not actually Irish!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Her agent advised her not to sweat it. â\\x80\\x9cIt was too late by then, they had cast me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Steve Buscemi in Boardwalk Empire. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a period of her life she looks back on fondly. For several years, during the seasonal shooting of the show, the family lived in New York, which she loved, although she says, drily: â\\x80\\x9cI do slightly wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d started my New York years before Iâ\\x80\\x99d had children. I spent most evenings at home.â\\x80\\x9d Her older son, Freddie, started preschool in the city â\\x80\\x93 heâ\\x80\\x99s very proud of this fact and holds it over his younger brotherâ\\x80\\x99s head â\\x80\\x93 and would get very cross when his mother slipped into British terminology. (â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99d stand there and shout, â\\x80\\x98Is it a buggy or is it a stroller?!â\\x80\\x99 I thought, â\\x80\\x98Fair enoughâ\\x80\\x99; there were two words for everything.â\\x80\\x9d) The main appeal of New York, she says, is how friendly it was compared with London, where they had lived when Freddie was a baby. â\\x80\\x9cI made proper friends in New York, people from all walks who werenâ\\x80\\x99t in my industry. I spent most of my time in Tompkins Square Park, in the East Village â\\x80\\x93 if I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t working, thatâ\\x80\\x99s where I was from morning to night, it felt like. And I would meet people and get chatting, and end up staying in touch and being friends with them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVicky McClureâ\\x80\\x99s lovely! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s that girl from school whoâ\\x80\\x99s super energetic and popular, and has time for everyone\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, in London, she says: â\\x80\\x9cI was in the park every day as well, and I would meet people and have a really nice chat, and it would be great. And then Iâ\\x80\\x99d see them the next day and it would be like weâ\\x80\\x99d never met. Iâ\\x80\\x99d say hello and they would look at me like I was a paedophile or something.â\\x80\\x9d She hoots with laughter and puts on a posh English accent: â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t try to be friends with me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoardwalk Empire, which ran to five seasons, was a hit. Macdonald was twice nominated for a Golden Globe and, in the off-season, won a coveted role to voice the lead in the Disney animated movie Brave. (She played Merida, the spirited, red-haired daughter of a Scottish king and queen, voiced by Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson.) It reminded her of being cast in Line Of Duty, oddly â\\x80\\x93 the sense of a big-ticket role in an iconic franchise. â\\x80\\x9cThe guest lead thing â\\x80\\x93 oooh. When I was doing press for [Brave], I was like, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m a Disney princess â\\x80\\x93 whoa, what?â\\x80\\x99 Being a guest lead in Line Of Duty is like that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tricky thing with Jed Mercurioâ\\x80\\x99s show is that since the scripts were only released to the actors a few episodes ahead of filming, Macdonald had no idea as she shot each scene just how good or bad the woman she was playing might be. â\\x80\\x9cJed had called my character enigmatic, so I clung on to that.â\\x80\\x9d Like an actor in a medical drama, she also had no idea what she was talking about a lot of the time. â\\x80\\x9cWe did a read-through and it was pretty hard going. I think we read three episodes, and I was just a shell of a woman by the end.â\\x80\\x9d This is why, she says, â\\x80\\x9cWhen my publicist sent me a list of things I could and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t talk about â\\x80\\x93 to be honest, itâ\\x80\\x99s the kind of detailed forensic policing that even when Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying the words, Iâ\\x80\\x99m only half aware of what I actually mean.â\\x80\\x9d She bursts out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonald at Loch Lomond.

Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fun shoot, she says, although BBC catering isnâ\\x80\\x99t in the same league as the HBO buffet table. â\\x80\\x9cOn Line Of Duty, you get a soggy sandwich. On American productions thereâ\\x80\\x99s a food table laid out all day long.â\\x80\\x9d I canâ\\x80\\x99t help it, the mad fan in me bursts out: whatâ\\x80\\x99s Vicky McClure like? â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s lovely! You know, sheâ\\x80\\x99s that girl from school whoâ\\x80\\x99s super energetic and popular, and has time for everyone. She has a big heart: sheâ\\x80\\x99s great.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLike every other production filming in 2020, they were interrupted for several months by the first lockdown. Macdonald says she found that period easier than subsequent lockdowns â\\x80\\x93 at least it was a novelty. Now she goes through revolutions of thinking the lockdowns will never end. She has binged a lot of TV. In fact, she says: â\\x80\\x9cAll I do is binge. I watched Bridgerton. I did Call My Agent, the French show, which is brilliant, and dry.â\\x80\\x9d She watched Michaela Coelâ\\x80\\x99s acclaimed I May Destroy You, which, to widespread dismay, was overlooked in the Golden Globe nominations. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s shocking that sheâ\\x80\\x99s not been recognised,â\\x80\\x9d says Macdonald. â\\x80\\x9cBut theyâ\\x80\\x99re all idiots. Incredible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are more projects in the pipeline, including a role in Shakespeare In Love director John Maddenâ\\x80\\x99s forthcoming adaptation of Ben Macintyreâ\\x80\\x99s second world war spy blockbuster, Operation Mincemeat. Professionally the hardest thing, these days, â\\x80\\x9cis working out being away from the kidsâ\\x80\\x9d, she says. â\\x80\\x9cThere would be jobs that came up on the west coast of America, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t do them, especially sharing custody. I was in Australia on a job a few years ago, and that was hard. They came out for a couple of weeks, but it was longer than I thought it would be. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do that again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is, she says, almost certainly turning into her mother, whose daffiness makes her roar with laughter. Macdonald was in the bank the other day and forgot the word for â\\x80\\x9cstatementâ\\x80\\x9d. (â\\x80\\x9cI ended up saying, you know the thing you send on the paper? And I made her forget the word statement. And I thought she was quiet because she was judging me, and then she finally blurted out â\\x80\\x98Statement!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d) Whole sections of the Line Of Duty script have quite gone from her mind. And she continues, with semi-regularity, to turn up at the wrong time for things.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreddie, she says, regards her as if she is mad. Meanwhile, she can rarely get through a chat with her own mother without falling into hysterics. The other day on the phone, she says, her mum â\\x80\\x9cwas trying to remember an actressâ\\x80\\x99s name and came up withâ\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 Macdonald starts laughing â\\x80\\x93 â\\x80\\x9cBlender Brethrone. She was like, â\\x80\\x98It had thingy in it, you know,â\\x80\\x99 and eventually thingy became Blender Brethrone. And I was like, â\\x80\\x98Mum, you do know, donâ\\x80\\x99t you â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d sheâ\\x80\\x99s shaking, shoulders heaving â\\x80\\x93 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98that Blender is not a name?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upside to getting older, says Macdonald, is that after years of feeling more or less terrified on every film and TV set, she has, in the last decade, begun mildly to unclench. There was something she used to do, up to Boardwalk Empire and beyond, which was to cling very rigidly to whatever bag or prop she was holding in a scene, to the degree that no one could prize it off her. â\\x80\\x9cWe cut to change the camera position, costume would come to take the bag, and Iâ\\x80\\x99d say, â\\x80\\x98No, no, noâ\\x80\\x99; Iâ\\x80\\x99d want to hold it in exactly the same way, all the way through. Like a freak.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonald finds the adrenaline useful. But, what with the pandemic and everything, sheâ\\x80\\x99s learned, recently, to relax. The previous day, she saw someone with a tattoo that read, â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s for you wonâ\\x80\\x99t go by youâ\\x80\\x9d, which struck a chord. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve had plenty of disappointments, like everyone else, and I have my little blips when I donâ\\x80\\x99t get a part I want. But I sort of believe that line.â\\x80\\x9d For those who are healthy and employed, itâ\\x80\\x99s the hard-won lesson of the year. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t be too disappointed, about anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",
       " 'I went to university in 2007. On my first day, every fresher had their photo taken; the pictures were pinned to a bulletin board in my halls. That evening, older male students scrawled on the photographs of the girls, rating our attractiveness. No one got in trouble. Later, the same men published a gossip magazine that Photoshopped images of female students on to porn stars, dissected our sex lives and made rape jokes. The magazine was printed using university funds. No one got kicked out. None of this seemed particularly objectionable to me, an 18-year-old girl. This was just the way things were. Internalised misogyny ran deep in the 2000s. Hell, I was just happy I got a high score on my photograph.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had largely forgotten about these incidents until I watched Framing Britney Spears, the much-discussed documentary about the media intrusion that contributed to Spearsâ\\x80\\x99s 2007 mental health crisis, and her efforts to free herself from a conservatorship administered by her father. Watching footage of a 17-year-old Spears smiling politely as a male interviewer asked about her breasts brought everything back. My God, I thought. For young women and girls, the 2000s truly were a cursed era.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a paparazzoâ\\x80\\x99s flashbulb exploding in the face of an It girl stumbling out of Chateau Marmont, the period is currently undergoing a stark reappraisal. And like those paparazzi photos, itâ\\x80\\x99s a none-too-flattering portrait. In addition to Framing Britney Spears, there is the upcoming Demi Lovato documentary Dancing With the Devil, which documents the 00s Disney starletâ\\x80\\x99s struggles with drug addiction. The recent BBC series Celebrity: A 21st-Century Story also features interviews with Kerry Katona and Charlotte Church, both tormented by the media in the 00s, and footage of paparazzi upskirting women as they get into cars. Horrifying interviews have resurfaced online; in one 2003 clip, Diane Sawyer makes Spears cry after blaming her for her breakup with Justin Timberlake. (Timberlake has been slammed online for his behaviour towards Spears, whom he shamed for their breakup, and Janet Jackson, whose breast he exposed at the 2004 Super Bowl, tanking her career.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000s, it was open season on young women. â\\x80\\x9cIt was blatant, horrifying misogyny,â\\x80\\x9d says the former New York Daily News gossip columnist Ben Widdicombe, author of Gatecrasher: How I Helped the Rich Become Famous and Ruin the World. He welcomes our soul-searching about the period. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad itâ\\x80\\x99s being re-evaluated,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cI think it has to be. The media was incredibly cruel to Britney and other women at the time. It was a great moral failing of the tabloid press, that we did that. And I unfortunately was a cog in that machine.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJanet Jackson and Justin Timberlake at Super Bowl XXXVIII. Photograph: Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty\\r\\n\\r\\nWiddicombe tells me that, even back then, the press treatment of Spears was horrifying to watch. â\\x80\\x9cIt was clear to us reporting staff at the time that we needed to leave Britney alone,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cHer mental health required the media to step back. But this voracious capitalist engine wasnâ\\x80\\x99t going to do that.â\\x80\\x9d While Widdicombe didnâ\\x80\\x99t personally report on Britneyâ\\x80\\x99s breakdown, he says he was powerless to stop his editors from splashing it on the front page, because there was simply too much money to be made from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWiddicombe says he feared that starlets would come to harm: â\\x80\\x9cI was seriously worried that either Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton or Britney Spears would die. Britney had mental health problems, Lindsay had a drug problem and Paris was known to drink and drive. And the media would pretend to hand-wring in sorrow, but actually their deaths would make a lot of money for them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy were we so fascinated with celebrity culture in the 2000s? Widdicombe traces it back to the 11 September terror attacks. â\\x80\\x9c9/11 was so traumatic and gruesome,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cWhen we recovered from the shock, editors said: â\\x80\\x98We need a picture of a beautiful young girl on page 12, and we need to know who sheâ\\x80\\x99s dating, and what parties sheâ\\x80\\x99s going to.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPop culture came roaring back, fuelled by the rise of snark-filled gossip blogs such as TMZ and PerezHilton.com, and celebrity-focused magazines including US Weekly in the US, and Heat and Closer in the UK. â\\x80\\x9cWe were able to see more of celebrities than ever before,â\\x80\\x9d says Matt James of the fan account Pop Culture Died in 2009, â\\x80\\x9cbecause we had the internet, which gave us exciting new reach into their lives. That, in turn, caused a boom in magazines and blogs. It was a perfect storm of this all coming together and creating a society that was fixated on celebrity in a way that it had never been before.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBritney Spears in 2001. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty\\r\\n\\r\\nThe editors of the gossip magazines and blogs rapidly realised that the public had an insatiable appetite for schadenfreude and cruelty, particularly when it came to young women. Upskirt photos were published in magazines such as Heat as recently as 2007, and readers wanted to see glassy-eyed women stumbling out of nightclubs, hair extension tracks clearly visible. The mags wanted to build up ordinary women â\\x80\\x93 such as Big Brother star Jade Goody â\\x80\\x93 then tear them apart when they failed. (Once the sweetheart of the tabloids, Goody was savaged for her racist bullying of fellow Celebrity Big Brother contestant Shilpa Shetty in 2007.)\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEverything was fine until the rise of Perez Hilton,â\\x80\\x9d said Mila Kunis, another star fixated on by the press, in 2018. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s what I would credit this industry crumbling on. He was the first person that â\\x80¦ literally just spread filth.â\\x80\\x9d In 2008, Perez Hilton sold T-shirts asking why Spears couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have died instead of Heath Ledger. Hilton apologised for some of his more lurid stunts in his 2020 autobiography, writing: â\\x80\\x9cI have a ton of regrets â\\x80¦ I never needed to be so mean or cruel.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was a market for shame when it came to women,â\\x80\\x9d says Tara Joshi, the co-host of Twenty Twenty, a podcast that examines 2000s pop culture. Joshiâ\\x80\\x99s co-host Simran Hans situates this wave of misogyny as a pushback against the riot grrrl movement of the early 90s, and the lad-culture-adjacent feminism popularised by the Spice Girls in the late 90s. â\\x80\\x9cIt was a reaction to the third wave of feminism in the 1990s,â\\x80\\x9d says Hans. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99d had the rise of ladettes and this reclaiming of being a â\\x80\\x98boyâ\\x80\\x99s girlâ\\x80\\x99. The 2000s felt like a punishment for women trying to get in on the act.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJade Goody leaves the Big Brother house in 2002. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the rise of this celeb-obsessed culture came another dangerous trend: size zero. Body positivity was nonexistent in the 00s; the ideal body was all clavicle and juddering hip bones. The It girls of the period â\\x80\\x93 such as Mischa Barton or Paris Hilton â\\x80\\x93 were extremely slim. On TV and in films, plus-sized women were either figures of fun, such as the â\\x80\\x9cfat Monicaâ\\x80\\x9d seen in flashbacks on Friends, or unlovable, like Gwyneth Paltrowâ\\x80\\x99s fatsuit-wearing character in Shallow Hal. Bridget Jones, the periodâ\\x80\\x99s fictitious everywoman, was in a continual battle to lose weight, despite the fact that she was only a size 12. (Conversely, some of the biggest movie franchises of the period, such as American Pie, were sexist fantasies in which nerdish men achieved their God-given right to have sex with attractive women.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forces of body shaming and cruelty towards young women converged disastrously. Heat magazine ran a celebrity cellulite special in 2004, ringing offending patches of fat on Martine McCutcheon and BeyoncÃ©â\\x80\\x99s legs with white circles. In his memoir The Celeb Diaries (2008), former Heat editor Mark Frith talks of searching for images of women looking â\\x80\\x9cterribleâ\\x80\\x9d, before printing images of Jennifer Lopez with cellulite on her thighs. For teenage girls, the message was circled in white on the cover of our favourite mags: if your thighs touched, you werenâ\\x80\\x99t trying hard enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI remember constantly reading headlines about how Charlotte Church was a size 12,â\\x80\\x9d says Hans. â\\x80\\x9cDiet culture was so pervasive, and wasnâ\\x80\\x99t yet tied up with wellness, and pinkwashed into something â\\x80\\x98feministâ\\x80\\x99 and acceptable.â\\x80\\x9d Emerging from the toxic swamp of 2000s diet culture as a teenage girl without an eating disorder was a real challenge. â\\x80\\x9cSo many people I knew had eating disorders,â\\x80\\x9d recalls Joshi. â\\x80\\x9cIt felt like a normal part of being a teenage girl.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor their part, some of the worst offenders in the decadeâ\\x80\\x99s apparent misogyny have apologised for their behaviour. â\\x80\\x9cMy actions contributed to the problem â\\x80¦ [I] benefited from a system that condones misogyny,â\\x80\\x9d said Timberlake last month in a statement addressing his behaviour towards Spears and Jackson. In interviews since Framing Britney Spears aired, Perez Hilton has said he now â\\x80\\x9cregretsâ\\x80\\x9d most of his comments about her. How sincere these apologies are, time will tell.\\r\\n\\r\\nGwynneth Paltrow in Shallow Hal. Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, any wider reckoning with 00s-era behaviour needs to recognise that these figures were not acting unprompted. There was an audience for cruelty, and we were it. â\\x80\\x9cThere is very little daylight between public demand and what the media is reporting on,â\\x80\\x9d says Widdicombe. â\\x80\\x9cIf people are writing 1,000 Britney stories, itâ\\x80\\x99s because thereâ\\x80\\x99s an audience for 1,000 Britney stories. Any reckoning of that era has to consider public consumption habits.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThings began to improve for women in the 2010s, with the rise of feminist publications such as Rookie magazine and so-called Tumblr feminism. â\\x80\\x9cMore positive representations of women became mainstream,â\\x80\\x9d says Hans. â\\x80\\x9cOnline there began to be more of a sense of community.â\\x80\\x9d Meanwhile, as legacy media waned, the free-for-all on young starlets abated (although a recent Sun article calling Lovato a â\\x80\\x9cdruggie messâ\\x80\\x9d represents the death rattle of a once all-powerful tabloid mentality).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to say that we are kinder to women in public life: one only needs to look at the treatment of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. But the tone of these articles is less overtly hostile; their sexism and racism more euphemistic.

       " 'Everyone told me that adopting a dog was a bad idea. I was an avid traveller; a freelance writer, and no great respecter of routine. My longest commitment to anything remains the direct debit for my phone network provider. But in March 2020, just as the world began to change, I headed to Battersea Dogs & Cats Home in London to meet an anxious greyhound called Jasper.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had told no one but my housemates of my plans to adopt. They had courteously agreed to cohabit with a canine and we had perused a site filled with drooling pit bulls and champagne puppies. Privately I dreamed of a dachshund. Then I met Jasper.\\r\\n\\r\\nA four-year-old greyhound who seemed more deer than dog, he was strikingly soft. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t just his downy fur â\\x80\\x93 a coat of cashmere, the colour of night rain â\\x80\\x93 but his large, amber eyes, which flashed as he nervously surveyed me. Jasperâ\\x80\\x99s anxiety entered the room before he did; a long, slow-passing cloud that stilted our interactions. Battersea told me he was an ex-racer from a British track. He had never lived in a home with an owner and was likely to have been mistreated. They left me alone with him for 20 minutes while I fed him treats and rubbed his ears. He was the most docile dog Iâ\\x80\\x99d ever met, but I had never really considered a greyhound. Is this the dog I want, I thought. Is he really mine? One hour later and we were in a cab home.\\r\\n\\r\\nLawton with her father, mother and brother, 1996. Photograph: courtesy Georgina Lawton\\r\\n\\r\\nI had meant to go home-home that week, to spend lockdown with my mother and brother in the place where I grew up, in Sutton and Carshalton on Londonâ\\x80\\x99s green commuter belt. But I figured Jasper needed to acclimatise to one house first, and stayed in London. â\\x80\\x9cWhy did you get a dog?â\\x80\\x9d my mum asked, exasperated. â\\x80\\x9cIs he trained?â\\x80\\x9d Jasper, like most retired greys, was house-trained but not very well socialised. Although he appeared to possess big-dog energy in abundance, weighing 30kg and looking, as one friend put it, â\\x80\\x9cscaryâ\\x80\\x9d, I soon realised it was actually he who was scared of everything. New people, other dogs, heavy traffic, balloons, car doors slamming, postal workers, his own shadow. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t respond to his name, and once, when I was adjusting his coat in the park, he darted off through my legs. â\\x80\\x9cJaaasper!â\\x80\\x9d I screamed as I watched him trot along the path with casual insouciance. I tried to catch up with him by cutting across the grass. â\\x80\\x9cStop that dog!â\\x80\\x9d Eventually someone did. I returned home to research remedies for the night-time barking that was disturbing my housemates and Googled: â\\x80\\x9cHow many times must you say a dogâ\\x80\\x99s name before he gets it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI often wonder how my dad felt when I was born. Is this the baby I want? Is she really mine?\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the challenging reality, I had always pictured myself as a dog owner, taking leisurely walks under summer skies with a furry friend who would bob at my heels, play fetch, and return on command. I wanted to indulge the tiny consciousness of a pet, to feel them curl up beside me on the sofa, hear their ritualistic roo-ing (a bark particular to hounds) in the suburban quiet. And after losing the greatest love in my life, my father, I also craved a new source of unconditional love.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jasper and I eventually went home to Sutton, I found that my mother and I disagreed on whether my father had truly loved dogs. â\\x80\\x9cHe wasnâ\\x80\\x99t really a dog man,â\\x80\\x9d she said, while I held that no, actually, he was. I can still see Dad in Ireland with Mumâ\\x80\\x99s family, rubbing the head of my cousinâ\\x80\\x99s black and white collie, Lassie. Or lying horizontal on the floor beside a board game at Christmas while tickling the belly of my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s springer spaniel. Admittedly the memories are less sharp, less saturated now that I approach the six-year anniversary of my membership to the Dead Dads Club. Grief, much like the cancer that killed him, is an invasion of small, internal growths. Slowly, it wilts memories. The intensity of my focus on my dadâ\\x80\\x99s characteristics, our shared moments together, fades a little more with each passing year. Yet I am sure he loved dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cHe wasnâ\\x80\\x99t really a dog man,â\\x80\\x9d my mum says, but I am sure my dad loved dogs.â\\x80\\x99 Photograph: JosÃ© Sarmento Matos/The Guardian\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother and I had disagreed on a lot more than this in recent years. We had spent some time estranged from one another, after DNA tests in 2016 confirmed that my father and I were not biologically related; it was a hidden truth that I blamed my mother for in his absence. My childhood had been cushioned and comfortable, aside from this family-wide silence and secrecy around my blackness. My parents were white, as were their parents, as was my younger brother. â\\x80\\x9cYou might be a genetic throwback,â\\x80\\x9d my mother had said, a phrase that anchored me into our family lore, but which I later realised didnâ\\x80\\x99t make any sense. Race and its meaning went ignored in our home for 23 years. Eventually, after the DNA results, I had therapy with my mother. In those early sessions, Mum was adamant that I was just exaggerating the impact of her racial denial. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t understand her lack of empathy, but reserved judgement on my father whose memory I wanted to protect. It had been an arduous, complex journey. Returning home now, and with a difficult dog in tow, could make or break us.\\r\\n\\r\\nParts of my past â\\x80\\x93 my heritage and biological parentage â\\x80\\x93 remain shrouded in mystery. Itâ\\x80\\x99s something I share with Jasper\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first it was strange seeing Jasper in the small back garden my dad used to manage, and which my mother now tended. I imagined the tone in which he would have called Jasper â\\x80\\x9clittle fellaâ\\x80\\x9d (as he had done with all dogs) and wondered how he would react to the giant swirls of shit on our lawn. On my first night back home, at the end of April, on what would have been my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s 60th birthday, I lost Jasper in the most dramatic fashion. Strolling around the deserted streets of Sutton as the evening was spitting rain, I slipped on the pavement and dropped his lead. Startled as he always was by loud noises, Jasper bolted into the night at full pelt, the heavy lead handle clattering behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wasnâ\\x80\\x99t sure if losing Jasper again was the final sign that I should hand him back, a divine intervention of sorts. Is this the dog I want? I wondered again as I tearfully trawled the streets with my mum and brother â\\x80\\x93 who had come at a momentâ\\x80\\x99s notice â\\x80\\x93 shouting Jasperâ\\x80\\x99s name and replaying the image of his sinewy silhouette disappearing into the void.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a stranger found him one mile from our house the next morning, after I had put out a Facebook alert, I was overjoyed â\\x80\\x93 but Jasperâ\\x80\\x99s paws were ripped to shreds. If my father had been around, he would have consoled me, told me it was not my fault, and ferried me to the vetâ\\x80\\x99s. Luckily my mother, who hates driving, dutifully cleared her schedule for vet-runs, helping me care for Jasperâ\\x80\\x99s wounds at home. She bought him treats, her affection growing simply because he came with me, her daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith her mother and Jasper, April 2020. Photograph: courtesy of Georgina Lawton\\r\\n\\r\\nJasper showed my mum, my brother and me that we could live in peace under one roof once more. The state-sanctioned stillness enabled once-difficult conversations about race and my dad to take place inside our home, or on joint dog walks. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot I would have done differently,â\\x80\\x9d Mum said to me over coffee as we discussed the Black Lives Matter protests taking place around the world in June. â\\x80\\x9cIf anyone said anything about who you are, your heritage... Iâ\\x80\\x99d be there for you.â\\x80\\x9d It felt hugely comforting. My mother had met the standards Iâ\\x80\\x99d set for us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a child I had often wondered whether I possessed some inherent trait that made me harder to love, whether there was a reason a large part of who I was went unacknowledged in our home. My mum reassures me that I did not, that identity erasure was never the aim, that my parents just didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to address her infidelity. But I often wonder how my dad felt when I was born. Was he disappointed, or dismayed, at the arrival of a black child who looked nothing like him? Is this the baby I want? Is she really mine? he must have thought. But I did not detect an ounce of uncertainty about me in our relationship, or ever witness anger towards my mother. She tells me that when I was born, he took me in his arms without question. He loved us all ferociously.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up, unsure of where I fitted in, I would sometimes test the elasticity of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s love. â\\x80\\x9cIf someone hurt me, Dad, what would you do?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, aged six, on the way back from school.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKill them,â\\x80\\x9d he replied without hesitation while gripping my hand as I swung my blue book bag in the air and giggled. My father was not a violent man, but as a child unsure of her family lore, I took this as affirmation that my place was always beside him, regardless of how we looked.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite more DNA testing, parts of my past â\\x80\\x93 my heritage and my biological parentage â\\x80\\x93 remain shrouded in mystery. This is something I share with Jasper, who I recently discovered comes from Ireland like my mother, not from the UK as I was told. This revelation, combined with frequent encounters with other dog owners, was almost too on-the-nose. Oh, what kind of dog is he? Where is he from? feels like the canine equivalent of asking a black or brown person: No, where are you really from? â\\x80\\x93 a question I have found ubiquitous in the context of my white family. Black greyhounds are Batterseaâ\\x80\\x99s most unpopular dog, and due to superstition and prejudice, black animals are adopted at much lower rates, globally, than other animals. Nervousness in a dog is also more likely to lead to euthanasia than other behavioural problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nJasper wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the Insta-perfect dog my friends had imagined me getting, but so what? I know that real love is not about optics, or biology, or even logic, but simply an innate connection to another living thing. With time and training and affection, Jasper has reminded me of what it takes to love and be loved: courage.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgina Lawton will be joining Nikesh Shukla and Nadia Owusu to share their personal stories of race, identity and belonging at a Guardian Live event on Monday 15 March.

       " 'When somebody suggested Beat Saber to me, I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t interested. First, it looks rather intimidating from the demo videos: youâ\\x80\\x99re inside a virtual reality headset, with a controller in each hand, which resembles a swishing lightsaber on your screen. You have to slice through bright blue and red blocks as they come rushing towards you, having first noticed which way their arrows point. Plus thereâ\\x80\\x99s music. If you can imagine being in an arcade with a hangover, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the dread that went through me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, you have to invest in a headset. There are about six that people recommend â\\x80\\x93 including a thrifty Hamswan one (Â£19.99) â\\x80\\x93 but only one thatâ\\x80\\x99s a stand-alone, in that you donâ\\x80\\x99t need to already have a PC to connect it to. I borrowed one, the Oculus. Itâ\\x80\\x99s expensive (Â£299) and I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to buy one. Except then I did, because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to give it back.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo start, you draw a circle on your floor with the controller, which is your game area. This stops you bumping into furniture, most of the time, and means you can play even in the most ridiculously small room. Then you pick a song. Everyone always picks Believer by Imagine Dragons, though there are plenty and you can buy more. The hardest part is the first beat: I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t work out exactly when to start, though I did work out how to switch off the â\\x80\\x9cfailureâ\\x80\\x9d function, which powers you out every time you fail. So that speeded things up a bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on what level youâ\\x80\\x99re on, at some point more big squares will start rushing towards you, besides the red and blue ones that youâ\\x80\\x99re meant to swish. These require you to duck, or lean, or do some other fast thing. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not just a workout for your arms and brain, itâ\\x80\\x99s a release: I experience utter concentration, intermittent exhilaration, like colouring in and going to a rave at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a distance, Beat Saber doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look like very strenuous exercise. But I took measurements on my Fitbit, which logs minutes of exertion (23 minutes counts as an exercise day). Every song counted as about six minutes of moderate to intense exercise, and I was averaging about 40 active minutes a day. (Sometimes, I notch up some cardio just whisking an egg or fighting with a teenager, so take it with a pinch of salt.) But nothing could deter me: not an ache or a pain, nor gloomy weather. The game was paired to my sonâ\\x80\\x99s phone and, for a while, before I figured out how to pair it to mine, too, he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t go to the toilet without me following him around, jonesing a go on The Greatest Showman. Donâ\\x80\\x99t ask why he takes his phone to the toilet. Itâ\\x80\\x99s what the young people do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I learned\\r\\n\\r\\nWith headsets, look for â\\x80\\x9cdegrees of freedomâ\\x80\\x9d. 3DoF recognises head movements but 6DoF includes three other body movements (up-down, left-right, forwards-backwards).',\n",
       " 'â\\x80\\x9cIt felt like we were the first black people ever to be up there. There must have been at least 200 people at that cafe on the top of Mount Snowdon and everyone was white. I was very proud of myself. I was like: â\\x80\\x98Yeah, Iâ\\x80\\x99m that black girl you saw walking up here.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Grace (not her real name) set off to complete the Three Peaks Challenge in 2019 â\\x80\\x93 a 23-mile (37km) hike that takes participants up the highest mountains in England, Wales and Scotland â\\x80\\x93 it was the furthest she had travelled since leaving her native country in southern Africa as a refugee. Before she discovered hiking, Britain â\\x80\\x9cfelt suffocatingâ\\x80\\x9d, like a country of bricks and mortar, with nothing to remind her of the village in which she grew up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a nine-month walking project set up by the Helen Bamber Foundation, a charity that supports survivors of human trafficking and violence, got her out in the hills. Though the project has finished, for Grace hiking has become a passion. She now spends every weekend discovering new beauty spots in and around the area where she currently lives. â\\x80\\x9cI had been in this country for a decade and I had never imagined that Britain has places that are this beautiful,â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess for ordinary people to the countryside in England has never been straightforward. The right to roam, after decades of protests, was only won in 2000 and still covers only about 8% of English land. The National Parks Act in 1949 may have been â\\x80\\x9ca peopleâ\\x80\\x99s charter â\\x80¦ for everyone who livesâ\\x80\\x9d, but for many the British countryside still feels like a no-go zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to recent statistics, only 3% of visitors to the parks are from ethnic minorities. Younger people, working-class people and those with disabilities are also underrepresented. In 2018, it was estimated that 18% of children living in the most deprived areas had not been on any trips into nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut over the last year, as people turned to the outdoors for comfort during lockdown, that has been changing, with groups popping up all over the country. â\\x80\\x9cI constantly get calls asking me about the next hill walk and all I can say is to hang fire for now,â\\x80\\x9d says Kash Butt, the co-founder of Boots and Beards. The children of Pakistani migrants, Butt and his cousin set up the hiking group for Asian Glaswegians after a successful family reunion up Conic Hill in the Loch Lomond national park.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen my parents came to this country, going out adventuring into the Scottish countryside was not really their priority. But we donâ\\x80\\x99t want people to miss out on what we have here,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cThe second we can get out again, weâ\\x80\\x99ll be ready.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProject One Climbing was set up by Carmen McIlveen from south London, who is one of the 1% of British climbing instructors from ethnic minorities. â\\x80\\x9cThe idea was just to take a couple of kids from the estate where I grew up to the local climbing wall, but then it snowballed in an incredible way,â\\x80\\x9d McIlveen says.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarmen McIlveen, who runs Project One Climbing. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\\r\\n\\r\\nMcIlveen has partnered with centres across the city and is planning to run larger outdoor camps â\\x80\\x9conce the kids have gotten used to the heightsâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Wanderlust Women, a mainly Muslim walking group from Lancashire, was set up in July last year, its founder had expected a maximum of eight women to join, but today their WhatsApp group has more than 100 members.\\r\\n\\r\\nKit Collective realised there might be a problem with access to equipment and has spent the past year getting outdoors brands to donate some of their stock, which it distributes to projects across the country. â\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t touch anything less than a 100 quid jacket or anything less than Â£100 shoes, because there is a massive difference,â\\x80\\x9d says Rory Southworth, who helps Kit Collective with procurement. â\\x80\\x9cYou put on a professional-level shoe and you feel like you should be on the hill, like you can tear down that descent: youâ\\x80\\x99ve got that confidence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOr as 18-year-old Mya-Rose Craig, whose charity Black2Nature runs camps for children and teenagers of colour in the south-west, puts it: â\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99ve got one pair of shoes and itâ\\x80\\x99s a really nice pair of trainers, why on earth would you want to go on a muddy walk through the fields, you know?â\\x80\\x9d Getting out to the country may be a problem, too. According to government statistics, black people are twice as likely as white people to live in a household with no access to a car or van â\\x80\\x93 vital for getting around the countryside.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut according to Mohammed Dhalech, the chair of Mosaic Outdoors, the main thing keeping people away is the nagging feeling they donâ\\x80\\x99t quite belong. â\\x80\\x9cI remember taking a group of multigenerational [minority ethnic] professionals out on a walk and I heard someone behind us say: â\\x80\\x98What are they doing here? They should be in London.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Other people he has spoken to report feeling uncomfortable after noticing waiters seat them at a distance from other customers in country pubs and restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, last summer, a combination of lockdown easing and good weather brought people en masse to nature spots around the country, it was often youths and people of colour who were blamed for extra litter and disturbances.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor Beattie, the chief executive of the South Downs national park, says he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t agree with that characterisation and positively welcomes people from the cities. â\\x80\\x9cIf more people are going to use the countryside, then there will be added pressures, but it is a wonderful opportunity. Right now, our rural economy is on its knees. It needs more diverse visitors and it needs them soon.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is overjoyed that more people are discovering the beauty of the countryside. As Grace says of her favourite hill: â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s this view all the way to the top where you can see the whole town spread out below you. For some of us, we canâ\\x80\\x99t leave this country â\\x80\\x93 but we can travel within it and find peace.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'With Scotlandâ\\x80\\x99s first minister Nicola Sturgeon giving evidence today, the Guardianâ\\x80\\x99s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, charts the unravelling of the alliance between first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond â\\x80\\x93 once seen as Scotlandâ\\x80\\x99s greatest political partnership\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guardianâ\\x80\\x99s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, discusses the turmoil inside the SNP, with Rachel Humphreys. Today Nicola Sturgeon gives evidence to the Scottish parliamentâ\\x80\\x99s inquiry into the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s handling of complaints of sexual assault against Alex Salmond. Sturgeon has been accused by the former first minister of possibly breaking the ministerial code and is subject to a second inquiry that will examine this.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday John Swinney, Scotlandâ\\x80\\x99s deputy first minister, agreed to release his governmentâ\\x80\\x99s legal advice on Salmondâ\\x80\\x99s court action after facing cross-party censure in Holyrood. It reveals that the Scottish government was warned by its senior lawyers it faced defeat in an ultimately successful legal action by Alex Salmond. The guidance, released by Scottish ministers on Tuesday, confirms that their two counsel told them the revelation that a senior official had previously met and briefed two complainers against Salmond had devastating consequences for their case. There were further developments yesterday when evidence from two other witnesses called into question Ms Sturgeonâ\\x80\\x99s version of events. Text messages between senior party and government officials, which Salmond last Friday claimed indicated that witnesses and the police were pressurised to pursue his criminal charges in order to overtake the judicial review, were handed over to the inquiry too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibby looks at the impact this could have on the SNP and its fight for a second referendum on independence. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a few months until Scotland heads to the polls. The way the allegations against Salmond have been handled could also have a devastating impact for the #MeToo movement and reporting of sexual assault and rape in Scotland, says Libby.',\n",

       " 'Barely two hours after Joe Root had taken five wickets in the third Test at Ahmedabad with his holiday-season off-breaks, the cricketer Alex Hartley tapped out a tweet meant to highlight the womenâ\\x80\\x99s match against New Zealand that evening. â\\x80\\x9cNice of the England boys to get this test match finished just before England Women play tonight,â\\x80\\x9d she wrote, followed by four hand clapping emojis. â\\x80\\x9cCatch them on @btsportcricket.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, Englandâ\\x80\\x99s men were then bowled out for 81 in the second innings and lost by 10 wickets in a Test that catapulted to an end within two days. And Hartley? She got death threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat had been a jokey attempt to advertise the game on which she was commentating later that night for BT Sport, which is covering the womenâ\\x80\\x99s series, turned into something quite else when the England opener Rory Burns picked up on it and retweeted it to his 25k followers, commenting: â\\x80\\x9cVery disappointing attitude considering all the â\\x80\\x98boysâ\\x80\\x99 do to support the womenâ\\x80\\x99s game.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of what the men do to support the womenâ\\x80\\x99s game was not the main topic for discussion that followed, as the tweet was liked by Ben Stokes and Jimmy Anderson, among others, before being deleted, and a digital firestorm descended on Hartley.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve described my tweet on my podcast [No Balls, with Hartleyâ\\x80\\x99s best friend, the England bowler Kate Cross] as â\\x80\\x98clumsyâ\\x80\\x99, and I can see that an England player seeing it would be really annoyed as it seems like I was celebrating their loss. I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t, and before Roryâ\\x80\\x99s tweet it had gone down really well with lots of people saying â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ll watch the women nowâ\\x80\\x99. The onslaught I got after Rory retweeted it I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wish on anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was really disappointed in the fact that England players, county players, England management, staff liked the tweet from Rory. I just think it highlights a lot of other issues in and around womenâ\\x80\\x99s sport that I really didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to bring up and talk about, but have to now. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99re supported enough by the men and it was a real shame that they believe they do support us. I think I even had Samit Patel writing, â\\x80\\x98Why would you tweet about womenâ\\x80\\x99s cricket?â\\x80\\x99, which is such a shame. I just hope some good can come of it and it will start conversations behind closed doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think Roryâ\\x80\\x99s just not understood what could come of him belittling me. All it would have taken was a private message saying I think this is bang out of order, to which Iâ\\x80\\x99d have messaged back saying: â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m so sorry, it was just a joke.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBurns and Hartley received a slap on the wrist from the England and Wales Cricket Board, but Hartley has not received apologies from any of the players involved. But two members of the ECB have rung more than once to say that things are being dealt with behind closed doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incident comes on the back of the social media abuse the rugby reporter Sonja McLaughlan received after Englandâ\\x80\\x99s defeat against Wales in the Six Nations, but it has not put Hartley off tweeting or the successful media career she is building alongside her cricket. â\\x80\\x9cIf you want to give me death threats youâ\\x80\\x99re the one with issues,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cI just think theyâ\\x80\\x99re sad individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really donâ\\x80\\x99t think I deserve to have people telling me to die [in a hole] and that Iâ\\x80\\x99m a really bad role model and womenâ\\x80\\x99s sport is rubbish and not worth watching. And I genuinely believe people only jumped on the back of my tweet because Iâ\\x80\\x99m a female, which is another issue.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe left-arm spinner lost her central contract at the end of the 2019 season, but in her time with England there was never any crossover between the menâ\\x80\\x99s and womenâ\\x80\\x99s teams. â\\x80\\x9cWe never came across the men, never spoke about the men, never had a relationship with them. I think Australia have it good because theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got two players who are married and Mitchell Starc will get the boys to rally around the girls and rightly so.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThings arenâ\\x80\\x99t going to change overnight, misogyny in sport canâ\\x80\\x99t change overnight. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about educating players and moving forward.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething that might have a chance of success with the Hundred, which opens in July with a womenâ\\x80\\x99s game between Hartleyâ\\x80\\x99s Manchester Originals and the Oval Invincibles and then moves into menâ\\x80\\x99s and womenâ\\x80\\x99s double headers. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t wait,â\\x80\\x9d says Hartley, who agrees that it might be a chance for the male and female players to bond. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve got to start somewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBT Sport will celebrate the sportswomen, broadcasters and production team who enrich its shows on International Womenâ\\x80\\x99s Day.',\n",
       " 'â\\x80\\x9cTotally unfairâ\\x80\\x9d Diego Simeone called it, but itâ\\x80\\x99s over now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Football Association handed Kieran Trippier a 10-week ban for breaking its betting regulations, AtlÃ©tico Madridâ\\x80\\x99s manager asked why it should be his club that paid and how the institution passing judgment could be the same one â\\x80\\x9cbenefitingâ\\x80\\x9d from it, claims of injustice crystallising around the timing: the England defender would miss 12 AtlÃ©tico games, including their first Champions League meeting with English opponents Chelsea, and conveniently return just in time for the next international break.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, Trippier returns just in time for something bigger. Available again having not played since January, on Sunday afternoon he will go straight back into the AtlÃ©tico side for the Madrid derby. Not just any Madrid derby, either. There will be no fans, a tiny handful of the 68,456 seats at the Wanda Metropolitano occupied and the rest lying empty, none of the atmosphere that makes this game so special. But it is a derby that may go a long way towards to deciding the league title.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlÃ©tico are five points clear of their neighbours and Barcelona with a game in hand over both, which they play against Athletic Bilbao next Wednesday. Win and they would take a big step towards the title, the mini-crisis in which they dropped as many points in 12 days as they had in the entire season until then put behind them. Lose and those doubts will deepen and the pursuit quicken, their nerves ever more frayed. Within four days, AtlÃ©tico could be 11 points clear with 12 games to go, or barely ahead at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nReal, meanwhile, could find themselves perfectly positioned for an assault on a league title that many had already been given up as lost. Or they could find their domestic season close to over. Everybody has been swift to insist there is a race to be had regardless of what happens here, Zinedine Zidane his usual picture of calm, but they know this is big. Which is perhaps why AtlÃ©ticoâ\\x80\\x99s chief executive complained about match officials being â\\x80\\x9cconditionedâ\\x80\\x9d by the refereesâ\\x80\\x99 chief saying Thomas Lemar should have been sent off last Sunday and why, for two days running, Real Madrid TV produced preemptive hit pieces on the referee, Alejandro HernÃ¡ndez HernÃ¡ndez.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may also urge caution, the desire to win weaker that the need not to lose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officials will, as ever, be the inevitable, tedious focus, but there are others, men more worthy of attention. Luis SuÃ¡rez and Karim Benzema especially. This game has two of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s best goalkeepers, Jan Oblak and Thibaut Courtois. There may be no better midfield anywhere than Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, and no better player in La Liga this season than Marcos Llorente, the AtlÃ©tico midfielder who began at Real, where his father, grandfather, uncle and great uncle all played. There may be no better redemptive story than SuÃ¡rez, although he has gone five games without a goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Trippierâ\\x80\\x99s return is genuinely significant. There is a reason he played every single league and Champions League minute until the ban. A reason why he immediately returned to the team when Fifa momentarily put that ban on hold: having missed two matches, he came back, played 90 minutes against Sevilla, provided an assist and then disappeared again when the ban was upheld. A reason he will go straight back into the starting XI on Sunday, even though the opponents are not the kind of side against whom you risk a man who hasnâ\\x80\\x99t played for two months.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlÃ©tico Madridâ\\x80\\x99s players during a training session this week. Photograph: Fernando Alvarado/EPA-EFE\\r\\n\\r\\nAt their Cerro del Espino training ground this week AtlÃ©tico prepared with him at right-back in a four. It is still possible Simeone opts for a five but either way Trippier will be in it â\\x80\\x93 and he is in extremely good shape too. Originally banned from training with his teammates or even alone at Cerro del Espino, isolated and following an individual programme at home, when Fifa applied what Simeone called â\\x80\\x9ca parenthesisâ\\x80\\x9d, he rejoined the group. Although the ban was upheld, AtlÃ©tico understood that they had Fifaâ\\x80\\x99s authorisation for him to train, against the FAâ\\x80\\x99s judgement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total, with Trippier in the team AtlÃ©tico won 11, drew two and lost one. They conceded only five times in 10 games. Without him, they won seven, drew two, and lost one in La Liga. They have conceded 11 goals in 10 games. It is no collapse, but it is a change. Until the tense 2-0 win at Villarreal last weekend, they had conceded in eight consecutive games â\\x80\\x93 the worst run under Simeone. Two draws and a defeat in four games suddenly revealed a vulnerability that had been sneaking up on them, on edge for a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not just about Trippier of course, but his absence mattered. Only one man had occupied the right-back slot all season. The first game Trippier was absent, against Getafe on 30 December, three men did so. Since then, five have â\\x80\\x93 Sime Vrsaljko, Yannick Carrasco, Ricard SÃ¡nchez, JosÃ© MarÃ\\xada GimÃ©nez, and Llorente â\\x80\\x93 and none entirely convinced. Those changes also conditioned everything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously playing just ahead and inside Trippier, an impressive understanding building between them, Llorente had been the best of those alternatives at right-back. But then he has been the best everywhere else too, Simeone all too aware that playing him in defence denies them an impact further up the pitch. To judge from the weekâ\\x80\\x99s preparations, Llorente may be chosen ahead of JoÃ£o FÃ©lix to play off the front against Madrid. His return to a more natural place could be key.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf AtlÃ©ticoâ\\x80\\x99s season has been marked by absences, so has Realâ\\x80\\x99s; if Simeoneâ\\x80\\x99s side may be marked by returns â\\x80\\x93 Carrasco is also available again â\\x80\\x93 so may Zidaneâ\\x80\\x99s. The Real Madrid coach said he has no explanation, but also said it is â\\x80\\x9cnot chanceâ\\x80\\x9d that they have sustained more injuries than anyone else â\\x80\\x93 just short of 40 this season. Eden Hazard, a phantom figure, irrelevant since joining Madrid, will be absent. So will Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal. The big question is whether Karim Benzema, who trained on Friday, makes it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe may need to. The contribution from Realâ\\x80\\x99s other forwards reads: VinÃ\\xadcius JÃºnior 3, Lucas VÃ¡zquez 2, Marco Asensio 2, Hazard 2, Mariano DÃ\\xadaz 1, Rodrygo 0, Isco 0. Their second-top scorer is Casemiro. Although they have improved defensively, clinching the kind of wins that won them the league title last year, they have struggled for goals. Last weekend â\\x80\\x93 in which first played sixth, second played fifth and third played fourth â\\x80\\x93 had been expected to load pressure on Diego Simeoneâ\\x80\\x99s side but instead ended with AtlÃ©tico winning in Villarreal and Real failing to defeat Real Sociedad.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now as derby day arrives the balance is tilted back in AtlÃ©ticoâ\\x80\\x99s favour, just as Trippier returns and with the AtlÃ©tico-supporting city mayor doing the honorary kick-off too. But they have never beaten their neighbours at the Wanda Metropolitano and if anyone knows never, ever to write off Real it is AtlÃ©tico. Trippier knows that, too. He returns at last, having been beaten only once all season. Having only even been behind once, in fact. And that was against Real.',\n",
       " 'Ilkay GÃ¼ndogan lives alone in Manchester and, during the past strange and solitary year, there have been times when a yearning for other people has left an ache inside him. Apart from one fleeting trip to Turkey in August to visit his family, he has not seen the people he loves most for more than a year. It is even longer since he was able to be with his closest friends in Germany. And so, when he has not been training or travelling to and from games or enjoying the purer pleasure of playing football for Manchester City, GÃ¼ndogan has often been lonely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the 30-year-old midfielder has been in the form of his life, scoring 11 goals in 21 Premier League appearances. Even more notably, City are in the midst of a record-breaking run of 21 successive wins. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s great,â\\x80\\x9d GÃ¼ndogan says of Cityâ\\x80\\x99s sustained blue streak. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s extraordinary, especially with the difficulties this season brings. And itâ\\x80\\x99s maybe unexpected, also for us, because I remember struggling at the beginning of the season.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGÃ¼ndogan shrugs wryly at the memory of losing 5-2 against Leicester and 2-0 against Spurs, in their only two defeats of the season. â\\x80\\x9cBut we learned from it.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s an incredible achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI also think this season brings more responsibility than ever. We all know the difficult situation the world is in. Everyone is struggling. But, as footballers, we are in a fortunate situation. We are still able to work and be in a routine, not sitting all day at home and waiting for better times. Iâ\\x80\\x99m still able to bring joy into peopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives because I get feedback from my mates back home in Germany. They keep telling me that football at the moment is the only thing that gives them a normal feeling in their lives.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGÃ¼ndogan talks freely, almost as if an interview is a chance to chat a little more deeply than he would do on a typical Thursday afternoon in his empty apartment. He looks into the computer screen which closes the 200-mile distance between us. Is this the first time he has lived alone for an extended period?\\r\\n\\r\\nGundogan celebrates scoring the opener during the recent win against Liverpool at Anfield. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. People always came to visit me in Manchester before. When I played for Dortmund I had family there and my close friend living around the corner. So every day I spent time with them. Even when I was playing for NÃ¼rnberg as a teenager I always had people visiting me. So this last year is the first time no one is able to be with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes he feel lonely? â\\x80\\x9cYes, of course I do. Itâ\\x80\\x99s normal. I find myself in a lonely place sometimes. But I try to stay positive and speak to all the people around me on video calls and WhatsApp.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHas the pandemic changed him? â\\x80\\x9cIn making me appreciate what I have, definitely. But mostly it showed me the most important thing is family and friends, people really close to our heart. Having that taken away is the hardest thing about this pandemic for me. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not like I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know all this before but it was maybe good to remember what matters most. This affects so many people â\\x80\\x93 even those who live close to their families. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whatâ\\x80\\x99s worse, having them so far away and not being able to see them, or having them so close but being apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was lucky I visited my parents in Turkey in August together with my brother, his wife and my little niece who was born last year. It felt like a family reunion but I also have a lot of family in Germany and my grandparents in Turkey. I was unable to see them for more than a year.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester City could only draw 1-1 with West Bromwich Albion in December but the game has helped to transform their season. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Reuters\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least football has been a ceaseless diversion and winning has softened the brutal overload of fixtures. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s intense,â\\x80\\x9d GÃ¼ndogan says. â\\x80\\x9cI agree that winning makes it easier but itâ\\x80\\x99s still very difficult. We had a lot of injuries to deal with but weâ\\x80\\x99ve done this in an amazing way. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s a proud moment to have so many consecutive wins. But if you donâ\\x80\\x99t win silverware itâ\\x80\\x99s not worth anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGÃ¼ndogan takes me back to before the start of the winning run and it seems timely because on Sunday City play Manchester United at home. United lie second in the table but are 14 points adrift of the runaway leaders. Yet when they met on 12 December they played out a dismal draw as City languished in ninth place, five points behind Tottenham. Three days later they faced West Brom, deep in the relegation zone and about to sack their manager Slaven Bilic, and they could only draw 1-1 at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut something had changed. GÃ¼ndogan scored his first goal in 22 games and Pep Guardiola, his manager, began to implement the tactical changes which would transform Cityâ\\x80\\x99s season. â\\x80\\x9cI remember that game,â\\x80\\x9d GÃ¼ndogan says. â\\x80\\x9cWe were in control but it was such a frustrating result. The most important thing was that against United we played a little differently and that was the start of our game changing in a tactical way.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe began to have a full-back [JoÃ£o Cancelo] going into midfield to create an overload of players there to give us an advantage. It took a bit of time until everyone understood what our manager wanted from us. But we now feel that if we play well we will get the results. Iâ\\x80\\x99m really convinced that all the credit has to go to Pep.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPep Guardiola and Gundogan during training in 2016. The German international was the Spaniardâ\\x80\\x99s first signing for Manchester City. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters\\r\\n\\r\\nCity have been without Sergio AgÃ¼ero and Gabriel Jesus for long periods but Guardiola has turned the absence of a striker into a virtue. He had encouraged his most versatile players, such as Cancelo and GÃ¼ndogan, who now operates in a more advanced role, to drive their changed formation. But has even GÃ¼ndogan sometimes found it strange to see Cancelo suddenly pop up alongside him in midfield? â\\x80\\x9cNot really, because JoÃ£o is technically so good at keeping the ball, moving the ball to the right man, in the right space, so it didnâ\\x80\\x99t surprise me that he is doing great in this different formation. JoÃ£oâ\\x80\\x99s quick and he gets back to his own position of being a full-back again. So we have a great defence, too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first six weeks of the year GÃ¼ndoganâ\\x80\\x99s nine goals meant he had found the net in that period more than any other player across Europeâ\\x80\\x99s top five leagues â\\x80\\x93 which is remarkable for a midfielder. Did his hot streak stem directly from Guardiola dispensing with the need for a striker? â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a mix of playing in that position and getting into a routine. Maybe I was also interpreting the position in a way which allows me to make runs into the opponentsâ\\x80\\x99 box or trying to be in the right space at the right time. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all about very responsible training so you get into a certain rhythm. By repeating this every game it helps you get on the score sheet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way in which GÃ¼ndogan can keep the ball and then release it quickly at the right moment, raising the pace of Cityâ\\x80\\x99s play, are quintessential attributes for Guardiolaâ\\x80\\x99s favourite players. He also makes runs with vision and accuracy which can shred the opposition. GÃ¼ndogan often looks like the definitive Guardiola player.\\r\\n\\r\\nGundogan sustained a series of injuries at Dortmund, the worst being a serious back injury in 2014. Photograph: Getty Images/Bongarts\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI take it as a compliment,â\\x80\\x9d he says, â\\x80\\x9cbecause when I played for Dortmund against Pepâ\\x80\\x99s teams at Barcelona and Bayern it was so difficult. Those teams always had an incredible plan from Pep. You feel the struggle on the pitch against his teams. So it was always clear that if I have the opportunity to work with him I have to take it. I always learn from him and an example is this season. In my career the maximum amount of goals for me during a season was five or six. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m already on 11 in the League [with two more goals in the Champions League]. I can do much more than I expected.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was Guardiolaâ\\x80\\x99s first signing for Manchester City in June 2016 and they live in the same apartment block. They have had a couple of dinners together at their respective homes but, as GÃ¼ndogan says, â\\x80\\x9che respects my privacy, I respect his privacy and for life to be normal when you get back from training you switch off. But when we meet each other in the building we always talk as people who like each other.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGÃ¼ndogan cried on Guardiolaâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder when he understood the severity of his ACL injury in December 2016. He was out for 276 days but he sustained a more serious back injury which meant he missed playing for Germany when they won the World Cup in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was definitely worse than my knee injury. I was out for 14 months but the worst part was that no one really knew what kind of injury it was. I saw a surgeon and he wanted to put a big screw in my back which would not allow me to play football at that level. So I was scared of not playing again and Iâ\\x80\\x99m really grateful I found the right [surgeon]. Of course I still have to deal with issues but Iâ\\x80\\x99m feeling well enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many moments of adversity in GÃ¼ndoganâ\\x80\\x99s life which help to explain his social conscience. During the pandemic he has led or contributed to schemes which help nurses in Germany and local businesses in Manchester, while also working on refugee programmes and for people in community care. â\\x80\\x9cWhen this pandemic came out of nowhere I understood I was not in a perilous situation myself. I had good food every day, my work routine and being in contact with family for video calls. There are people in much worse situations and I felt a responsibility to help in Germany and here.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was inspired by Larry Nance, the NBA player for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and all he is doing with his charity. I met him three years ago when he came to our game and I heard about all his projects to help people in Cleveland. I thought it was a great idea to do the same in Manchester. We collected enough money and in the next few days we will make an announcement about where it will go to. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an opportunity to bring a bit of light in this pandemic. It also makes many of us feel higher responsibility to do something which is a great thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCityâ\\x80\\x99s slick blue machine, meanwhile, will achieve their 22nd successive victory if they beat United and match Real Madridâ\\x80\\x99s winning run in 2014. Only Bayern and Ajax will be ahead of them in the European record books. Bayern won 23 games in a row last year while Ajax won 25 in 1995 and 26 matches in 1971-72.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs GÃ¼ndogan aware of these records? â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he says before nodding when I point out all four of those winning runs were in seasons sealed by victory in the European Cup or Champions League. City should win the Premier League again but they have endured disappointment in Europe and lost surprisingly to Spurs and Lyon the past two years. Is there a psychological hurdle they need to conquer in the Champions League?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say so. We made mistakes and struggled. But we have a new chance this year. We will try to play as well as possible, but itâ\\x80\\x99s a difficult time and challenging for us as human beings dealing with this pandemic. So I have no idea how even the next two weeks will look like. I just hope that as soon as possible we all can go back to our normal lives and socialise again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid this quest for normality the remorseless aim for Manchester City will be to maintain their abnormal winning run. â\\x80\\x9cIf that comes,â\\x80\\x9d GÃ¼ndogan says with a little smile, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll take it.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'When the National League north and south divisions were declared null and void on 18 February, anyone expecting that to be the end of the matter would have been naive in the extreme. Englandâ\\x80\\x99s sixth tier is a perplexing tangle of competing motivations but a sizeable number of those who had been outvoted found themselves united behind one target: to complete the 2020-21 campaign on the field, whatever that took.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture is only beginning to clear now but, over the coming days, those that wanted to play on should find out whether they will get their wish. A knife-edge set of negotiations between the clubs involved has, the Guardian understands, resulted in a proposal for an elegant solution being put to the National League. If they and, subsequently, and Football Association wave it through â\\x80\\x93 perhaps as soon as next week â\\x80\\x93 the season will be played out in an improvised format that ensures promotion challengers do not have to endure their ambitions going up in smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is little surprise that Gloucester City and Dorking â\\x80\\x93 the divisionsâ\\x80\\x99 leaders â\\x80\\x93 have led the crusade to play on. Both have threatened legal action against the null and void outcome and they have been motivated in part by the slim margin by which clubs in the north and south voted to end the season. The vote was passed by 24-19, with a majority in the south in fact wanting to continue, and it escaped nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s attention that the number of dissenters would be sufficient to proceed with a rehashed competition among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat led to an open letter, signed by 18 clubs, being sent to the National League general manager Mark Ives on 19 February. They asked that the league â\\x80\\x9cstrongly consider that the two divisions at step 2 continue playing their seasons, either separately as oneâ\\x80\\x9d; Ives said earlier this week that it would â\\x80\\x9cconsider an alternative, viable solutionâ\\x80\\x9d and those involved are optimistic their exhaustive efforts stand a chance of bearing fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nA senior figure at one club that wants to keep playing said they were more confident of a resolution than they had been at the outset. Granular detail of what the proposal is hard to come by given a non-disclosure agreement was signed between the clubs working to continue. The plan handed to the National League is likely, however, to involve a single cross-country competition that is open to anyone who wishes to compete, whether or not they previously voted to end the season. Teams would only play each other once, with midweek travel localised, and there would be two promotion places â\\x80\\x93 one automatic, one via a play-off â\\x80\\x93 to the National Leagueâ\\x80\\x99s top division.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat would mean the top flight, which voted to continue without relegation and will put on a full schedule this weekend, swells to 25 teams next season. The picture becomes fuzzier if the teamsâ\\x80\\x99 different positions when the music stopped are taken into consideration: most wish to carry on because they sense at least a faint whiff of success but should Gloucester, who have 35 points from 18 games, begin on level pegging with Hemel Hempstead â\\x80\\x93 who have amassed 20 from 18 â\\x80\\x93 or will proceedings restart with points per game carried over?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an awareness that any new format needs to be cleared by the authorities quickly: 20 March has been mooted as a start date but there is, at least among some clubs not directly involved, a sense of scepticism over the prospect of administrative hurdles being cleared by then.\\r\\n\\r\\nHavant & Waterloovilleâ\\x80\\x99s Westleigh Park, in November. Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\\r\\n\\r\\nOne bone of contention may lie in the leagueâ\\x80\\x99s hands. A suggestion put to the Guardian was that the scheme may be put to another vote between clubs in all three divisions, which would risk eating up time and fomenting dissent. That idea has been questioned by at least one club owner but it suggests the best-laid plans may yet meet last-minute hurdles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of those who originally sought an on-pitch conclusion have opted not to prolong their fight. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just the wrong thing at the wrong time for us,â\\x80\\x9d says the Havant and Waterlooville director Trevor Brock, whose club announced on Thursday that, despite signing the original open letter, they will not participate further. â\\x80\\x9cOur players are on furlough and out of training so it would be difficult to field an appropriate side. Playing in this league would only be about getting promoted and it would cost us too much to get involved, particularly if we have to pick a lower-level team.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nConcord Rangers have made a similar judgment and it is understood others may yet fall by the wayside too. Meanwhile Gloucester are among those raring to go and will face Oxford City in an â\\x80\\x9cextended training sessionâ\\x80\\x9d on Saturday. They and their peers feel sponsorship deals and other financial opportunities hinge on continuation, quite aside from the prospect of promotion. The stakes feel higher than ever; pulling off a balancing act that allows a semblance of normality to reappear would be all partiesâ\\x80\\x99 greatest achievement of the most turbulent season in memory.',\n",

Very probably this case will not be heard for all of 2021.â\\x80\\x9d United did not want to comment on the latest developments on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defender was arrested after a brawl outside a Mykonos town bar led to a run-in with undercover policemen attempting to break up the fracas. Maguire, who turned 28 on Friday, has vigorously denied the accusations, with his defence team calling them â\\x80\\x9cwrong and misleadingâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nDays after his arrest, the England international told the BBC his conscience was clear and described how he had been â\\x80\\x9cscared for my lifeâ\\x80\\x9d and afraid he was being kidnapped when the officers initially detained him on the party isle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being handed a 21-month prison sentence, suspended for three years, the defender immediately appealed against the verdict. His two co-defendants, who included his footballer brother Joe, were given 13-month suspended sentences. They have also appealed. All three were allowed to walk free after the court acknowledged their clear criminal records.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Greek law an appeal amounts to a retrial with the higher tribunal having up to eight years to hear the case. When it does take place Maguire will face a three-member panel of appeals court judges, also on Syros.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, Panaghiotis Poulios, the islandâ\\x80\\x99s chief prosecutor, contracted Covid, further adding to delays. But while legal proceedings in theory could take place as late as 2028, Ioannis Paradissis, the prosecution lawyer handling the case, said there was a desire to have it wrapped up as soon as possible. â\\x80\\x9cMy clients want to see the end of this matter,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer, who represented two of the policemen who appeared as key witnesses during last yearâ\\x80\\x99s one-day trial, reiterated that if Maguire apologised he would likely be treated â\\x80\\x9cmore lenientlyâ\\x80\\x9d by the appeals court judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn Greek criminal law if an apology is made, if you accept you are guilty, you are treated more leniently,â\\x80\\x9d he told the Guardian. â\\x80\\x9cMy clients were just doing their jobs and were injured in the incident. They are still expecting an apology and living in hope that, before long, he will say sorry to them.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Gordon Elliott, one of racingâ\\x80\\x99s most successful trainers, has been banned from training for 12 months by the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB), with the final six months suspended, over a photograph which showed him sitting on a dead horse on his gallops which emerged last Saturday. The penalty will come into force on 9 March, a week before the opening day of the Cheltenham Festival where Elliott has twice been the leading trainer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IHRBâ\\x80\\x99s verdict concluded an eight-hour hearing of the case on Friday, and could lead to a new trainer taking temporary control of Elliottâ\\x80\\x99s yard in County Meath before the Festival meetings at both Cheltenham and Aintree, where the stable is likely to have runners in the Grand National on 10 April.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe verdict also noted a â\\x80\\x9csinister aspectâ\\x80\\x9d to the case, accepting that â\\x80\\x9cthe release of this photograph is part of a concerted attack upon Mr Elliott, the full circumstances of which are unknownâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nElliott released a statement shortly after his suspension was announced in which he said that he had been â\\x80\\x9cdealt with fairlyâ\\x80\\x9d by the regulator and that he â\\x80\\x9cwill carry the burden of my transgressions for the rest of my careerâ\\x80\\x9d, adding: â\\x80\\x9cI will never again disrespect a horse living or dead and I will not tolerate it in others.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nElliott also acknowledged that he is â\\x80\\x9cin this situation by my own action and I am not going to dodge away from thisâ\\x80\\x9d.

These include serious damage to his reputation and, anecdotally, substantial economic loss through loss of business contracts and departure of horses from his yard to be trained elsewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nElliott will also pay the IHRBâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x82¬15,000 costs in bringing the case, and has agreed not to attend any race meeting or point-to-point event for six months.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement on Friday evening, the British Horseracing Authority welcomed â\\x80\\x9cthe fact that the Irish authorities have acted quicklyâ\\x80\\x9d, adding that â\\x80\\x9crespect is an integral and essential part of the duty of those in charge of animalsâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts statement continued: â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x99s decision confirms that horses will not be able to run at the Cheltenham Festival or Grand National Festival in the name of Gordon Elliott.

First, it wraps you in an ersatz sheen of pseudo-selflessness. The more lavishly you clap â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cthe healthcare heroesâ\\x80\\x9d, the better you persuade the voters that you too care. Second, all those public declarations of praise â\\x80\\x93 so fervently tweeted, televised, promoted and shared â\\x80\\x93 have the advantage of being entirely free. They cost the politician, and the Treasury, nothing at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99ve had a year of performative gestures. That never-ending applause from the steps of Number 10, those photo ops of Johnson in goggles squirting water into test tubes, the extraordinary footage of Hancockâ\\x80\\x99s dry-eyed tears when the health secretary was seemingly overcome with emotion at the arrival of Covid vaccines.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, though, the mask has well and truly slipped. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve discovered precisely how much Johnson really values NHS staff. And â\\x80\\x93 in an inverse relationship to the zeal with which he has clapped â\\x80\\x93 it turns out the answer is one Pret a Manger sandwich. Yes: Â£3.50 a week is precisely how much extra he thinks each NHS nurse deserves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncredibly, the 1% pay â\\x80\\x9criseâ\\x80\\x9d the government has proposed for NHS staff â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s a real-terms pay cut, of course, once inflation is factored in â\\x80\\x93 is being touted as beneficence. Indeed, the minister for mental health, Nadine Dorries, has insisted she is â\\x80\\x9cpleasantly surprisedâ\\x80\\x9d by the proposal, adding that she believes â\\x80\\x9cnurses are about more than superficial soundbites, I think nurses love their job. They do their job because they love their job.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere it is, that word â\\x80\\x9cloveâ\\x80\\x9d again. Never have four letters been used so vacuously. To dispel any lingering prime ministerial doubts, the NHS is powered not by love but by its annual budget â\\x80\\x93 and love has never paid a hard-pressed nurseâ\\x80\\x99s grocery bills. Many NHS staff do indeed love their jobs, but we still have mortgages and gas bills, and hungry kids to feed. We will go the extra mile for patients again and again, but that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean our better natures should be exploited by Number 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson needs to understand that love â\\x80\\x93 real, genuine NHS love â\\x80\\x93 is neither trite, nor easy, nor effortless, nor glib. NHS love is caring for a colleague as they suffocate from Covid, knowing that you could be the next to be infected and die. NHS love is being failed by the government on protective equipment but working regardless, wrapped in hospital bin bags and a visor you had to buy from B&Q.\\r\\n\\r\\nNHS love is kneeling on the floor to help a child into a mask and apron so she can say goodbye to Mummy, who is dying in intensive care. NHS love is nearly vomiting with anxiety by the side of the road â\\x80\\x93 because thereâ\\x80\\x99s only so much dying one human being can take â\\x80\\x93 before setting off again towards the patients you know still need you. NHS love is the doctors and nurses who even now, as I type, are suffering from PTSD, anxiety and depression in their droves: who feel they canâ\\x80\\x99t go on, who are broken, who have even talked of suicide when their defences are down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis government insists a proper NHS pay rise is unaffordable. They bow their heads and say, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, our hands are tied.â\\x80\\x9d Itâ\\x80\\x99s claptrap, of course. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a political choice. This is, after all, the very same government that is perfectly willing to spend Â£65bn on the first phase of HS2 â\\x80\\x93 a project whose total cost could climb to Â£107bn or more, even as it seems that fewer of us will be making train journeys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, then, is the stark truth behind the derisory 1% pay offer. If the prime minister can afford to spend two-thirds of the entire NHS annual budget on a very fast train, he can also afford to reward NHS staff with a real-terms pay rise. The fact that he has chosen, quite deliberately, not to do so speaks volumes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the praise was empty, the sycophancy merely that. This government has made no meaningful commitment to the NHS or NHS staff at all. The sorry truth, as every NHS nurse whoâ\\x80\\x99s ever used a food bank knows, is that money canâ\\x80\\x99t buy you love â\\x80\\x93 and love canâ\\x80\\x99t buy you anything at all.',\n",
       " 'Racism is a lucrative business. When it comes to Meghan Markle, the mediaâ\\x80\\x99s strategy is transparent. Tabloids pillory her with a range of mostly ludicrous allegations â\\x80\\x93 her baby bump is too prominent, her avocados are not â\\x80\\x9cwokeâ\\x80\\x9d, her earrings are drenched in blood â\\x80\\x93 and then networks double up with manufactured debates in which anti-racist commentators try to push back on those narratives.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s no wonder that, in the teaser for his forthcoming interview with Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry referred to history repeating itself. We saw a similar strategy of obsession and vilification play out with his mother. The genius of it then and now â\\x80\\x93 from a tabloid perspective â\\x80\\x93 is that they as perpetrators are also the major beneficiaries, as their endless coverage racks up clicks and newspaper sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing this, and being aware that this discourse is rarely designed to achieve progress or change, has made me reluctant to continue entering the fray. I have not answered the literally hundreds of calls Iâ\\x80\\x99ve received recently from broadcast networks, asking me to comment first on the state of Meghanâ\\x80\\x99s womb (presumably the entire nation feels entitled to have a view), and then on her decision to speak to Winfrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is the general obsession with celebrities and royals, and then there is the particular shape this obsession takes when the object in question is a woman of colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s hardly breaking news that the British media is often driven by deeply racist instincts. You never have to look far to illustrate the point. â\\x80\\x9cDo you look at [Meghan] and see a black woman? Cause I donâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said LBC host Andrew Pierce. â\\x80\\x9cI see a very attractive woman. Itâ\\x80\\x99s never occurred to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that being attractive and being black are mutually exclusive has a long history in Britain. The very first time I was interviewed by a newspaper, aged 18, I was asked to comment on Jeffrey Archerâ\\x80\\x99s view that, in the past, â\\x80\\x9cyour head did not turn in the road if a black woman passed you because they were badly dressed, they were probably overweight and they probably had a lousy jobâ\\x80\\x9d. (At the time Archer was the Conservative candidate for mayor of London.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPierce simply offered us an up-to-date example of how, confronted with Meghan â\\x80\\x93 a black woman he does consider attractive â\\x80\\x93 commentators reconcile this apparent anomaly by reclassifying her as not black at all. And so that cycle continues.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo does the one involving the character assassination of women of colour as a kind of sport. The Mail on Sunday was willing to break the law â\\x80\\x93 as a recent high court summary judgment established â\\x80\\x93 and to take its attack on Meghan to a new low. Having obtained and published a distressing handwritten letter from Meghan to her estranged father, the tabloid deployed a handwriting expert to reveal that her penmanship shows her to be, â\\x80\\x9ca showman and a narcissistâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cself-awareâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cself-orientedâ\\x80\\x9d, someone who suffers from â\\x80\\x9canxietyâ\\x80\\x9d. It would be strange not to suffer from anxiety, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it, when the media is using your private life for a feeding frenzy, and the institution capable of shielding you â\\x80\\x93 in this case, Buckingham Palace â\\x80\\x93 has decided to sit back and watch?\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the palace has decided that this precise moment â\\x80\\x93 days before the Sussexâ\\x80\\x99s highly anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey is broadcast â\\x80\\x93 is the right time to launch an investigation into allegations of bullying made by former royal aides against Meghan three years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nBullying allegations must be taken seriously. That should have been the case for home secretary Priti Patel, who was found culpable of abusing senior civil servants and has just paid out Â£340,000 to one of her accusers. Yet despite being accountable to the electorate, her political career seems unscathed by this. Clearly she plays a useful role for Boris Johnson, who has consistently protected her, even when she was found by his independent adviser to have broken the ministerial code, which is normally a resigning offence.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s richly ironic therefore that the media â\\x80\\x93 which has relentlessly bullied Meghan, including most intensely during two periods when she has been pregnant â\\x80\\x93 is now consumed with these latest allegations that she herself is a bully. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also not without context because â\\x80\\x93 as numerous black women have attested of their experiences in white spaces â\\x80\\x93 we are frequently perceived as threatening.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have my own painful memories of how, as a teenager, younger children at my school said they found me â\\x80\\x9cterrifyingâ\\x80\\x9d, and how I was dubbed â\\x80\\x9cScary Spiceâ\\x80\\x9d. Being biracial did not exempt me from being perceived as frightening simply because of my physical appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s difficult to compare these personal experiences to those facing Meghan, because she has become a fixation of the global news media in ways few of us can imagine. She is in this position because of her relationship to the palace â\\x80\\x93 a unique institution that creates global superstars who are not elected, not accountable to the electorate. In her case, she no longer even lives at the taxpayersâ\\x80\\x99 expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet there is so much the palace could have done to provide Meghan with the same shielding that other senior members of the royal family enjoy. For Prince Andrew, who has faced allegations of involvement in sexual abuse, a palace spin doctor even tried to enlist the help of an online troll to discredit the princeâ\\x80\\x99s accuser.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would condemn the idea of discrediting Meghanâ\\x80\\x99s sex abuse accusers; except she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have any. I would criticise Meghan for visiting Saudi Arabia, as other members of the royal family have on many occasions; except she has never set foot there.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, she reportedly wore a pair of earrings gifted by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose track record of extreme human rights abuses, including authorising the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the dismal war in Yemen, has not prevented our nation from selling him arms. I doubt the royal family will open an investigation into this particular allegation anyway, since doing so would offer an inconvenient reminder to countries in the former empire â\\x80\\x93 now its Commonwealth friends â\\x80\\x93 of how much of royal treasure was stolen from them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would criticise Meghan for furthering Prince Philipâ\\x80\\x99s current state of ill health, except â\\x80\\x93 contrary to the suggestion of one royal commentator â\\x80\\x93 it has nothing to do with her whatsoever. If Meghan can be linked to murder for wearing jewellery, I dread to think what sheâ\\x80\\x99d be blamed for were his condition to get worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest irony in all this, of course, is that Meghan left Britain â\\x80\\x93 as I suspect we will discover with some clarity when her Oprah interview is broadcast â\\x80\\x93 to get away from the toxic and racially motivated media obsession with her. And yet even in its remarkable track record of denying her the basic human expectations of privacy, the media are outdoing themselves all over again in proving that her judgment was right.',\n",
       " 'A year ago, I was contending that as someone who had always worked from home Iâ\\x80\\x99d been in training for a global pandemic for 30 years: Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do your lockdown standing on my head â\\x80\\x93 bring it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was a couple of lockdowns ago, but itâ\\x80\\x99s only recently that something has arrived to upset my mental equilibrium: hope. After months safely cloaked in the armour of despair, hope has suddenly left me unpeeled and paranoid: in my dreams, dark forces range against me, and the police are often involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn my way back from the shops I witness a confrontation that seems to reinforce my deepest fears, between a car and a motorcycle facing each other in the middle of a narrow street. The motorcyclist is loudly alleging, not without evidence, that the road is one-way â\\x80\\x93 the way he is going.\\r\\n\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know about you, but my reaction to getting caught driving the wrong way down a one-way street has always been instant mortification.

While itâ\\x80\\x99s true there have been some road closures, her implication â\\x80\\x93 that the neighbourhood is inescapable by lawful means â\\x80\\x93 is fanciful.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will not let you endanger others!â\\x80\\x9d shouts the motorcyclist. â\\x80\\x9cBack up!â\\x80\\x9d The driver refuses. I watch for as long as I can, but in the end I have to leave them there.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should have known,â\\x80\\x9d I say to my wife later. â\\x80\\x9cSociety was always going to undergo complete collapse long before I got vaccinated.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt smells like spring!â\\x80\\x9d she says, opening the back door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop being hopeful,â\\x80\\x9d I say. â\\x80\\x9cHope only asks for trouble.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think I might do a bit of gardening,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s so warm!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s too early,â\\x80\\x9d I say. â\\x80\\x9cThis warmth is deceptive.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right, everything is terrible,â\\x80\\x9d she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo ahead,â\\x80\\x9d I say. â\\x80\\x9cLet your guard down and see what happens.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife finds a trowel and starts weeding the beds. I sit watching until guilt overcomes me. I go outside, pick up a fork and turn over a few square metres of earth. The sun is shining, drying the dew on the ivy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter lunch, against my better judgment, I plant a row of seeds. Then I make a coffee and sit on the garden bench, turning my face to the sun and closing my eyes. I can hear birds singing and, in the distance, children playing. On the far side of the wall a voice is describing the flowers in the lane that runs along it to someone who must be on the phone, because there is never any answer. I soon drift off, into a dream involving border guards, water cannons and some insufficient paperwork on my part.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s this newspaper columnist,â\\x80\\x9d says a voice. I wake with a start, pouring the last of my coffee over my knee. I blink, and look around me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGuh,â\\x80\\x9d I say, staring at my empty cup. Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting tired of paranoid dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the magazine,â\\x80\\x9d says someone. â\\x80\\x9cYou know, the supposedly lighthearted columnist.â\\x80\\x9d A breeze turns my damp knee cold. The voice â\\x80\\x93 the same one that was describing snowdrops a moment ago â\\x80\\x93 is getting louder and quieter as it moves back and forth along the lane on the other side of the wall. It takes me a moment to realise itâ\\x80\\x99s not part of the dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s always saying he lives round here,â\\x80\\x9d the voice says.

       " 'Vaccines manufactured in India for the global vaccine access programme, Covax, have reached Ghana, Ivory Coast and Colombia over the past 10 days. This was undoubtedly a moment of celebration that the miracle of science was being shared â\\x80\\x93 but it was offset by the shame that many countries hit hard during the pandemic have still not received any vaccines.\\r\\n\\r\\nSafe and effective vaccines have been developed and approved at record speed, giving us a crucial new way, in addition to traditional public health measures, to protect people from the virus. Now we must ensure theyâ\\x80\\x99re available to everyone, everywhere. Sharing doses, boosting manufacturing by removing barriers and ensuring that we use data effectively to target left-behind communities is key to ending this crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI appreciate that India is sharing doses now, and also welcome G7 countries committing to sharing a portion of their vaccines, as well as pledging significant amounts of new funding to Covax.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, of the 225m vaccine doses that have been administered so far, the vast majority have been in a handful of rich and vaccine-producing countries, while most low- and middle-income countries watch and wait. A me-first approach might serve short-term political interests, but it is self-defeating and will lead to a protracted recovery, with trade and travel continuing to suffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny opportunity to beat this virus should be grabbed with both hands. New variants are appearing that show signs of being more transmissible, more deadly and less susceptible to vaccines. The threat is clear: as long as the virus is spreading anywhere, it has more opportunities to mutate and potentially undermine the efficacy of vaccines everywhere. We could end up back at square one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeads of state, international agencies and civil society groups have already signed up to a vaccine equity declaration that calls on governments and manufacturers to speed up regulatory processes and boost manufacturing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut boosting manufacturing wonâ\\x80\\x99t happen by itself. We are living through an exceptional moment in history, and must rise to the challenge. Whether itâ\\x80\\x99s dose sharing, tech transfer or voluntary licensing, as the WHOâ\\x80\\x99s own Covid-19 Technology Access Pool initiative encourages, or waiving intellectual property rights, as South Africa and India have suggested, we need to pull out all the stops.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlexibilities in trade regulations exist for emergencies, and surely a global pandemic, which has forced many societies to shut down and caused so much harm to business â\\x80\\x93 both large and small â\\x80\\x93 qualifies. We need to be on a war footing, and itâ\\x80\\x99s important to be clear about what is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we need sustainable vaccine manufacturing and production across the globe. This will be useful in this pandemic and critical for future ones. Some companies, like AstraZeneca, have shared their licences so that vaccines can be manufactured at multiple sites. Others, like Pfizer and Sanofi, have made agreements to transfer technology, such as the finishing of vaccine vials. Some governments, such as Canada, have also made deals with individual companies and are setting up entirely new manufacturing units, which will produce new doses in a matter of months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are significant steps but we cannot rest until everyone has access, and we need to ensure sustainable vaccine supply chains for the long term that are vastly bigger than what we have now. This will become even more important if we have to vaccinate people with boosters or reformulate vaccines to tackle variants. Waiving patents temporarily wonâ\\x80\\x99t mean innovators miss out. Like during the HIV crisis or in a war, companies will be paid royalties for the products they manufacture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some things that the private sector does really well and there are other areas where governments need to step in. I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that globally weâ\\x80\\x99re exercising our full manufacturing muscle at present. For example, some manufacturers have not been able to produce successful vaccine candidates, which is to be expected, but their production facilities could be repurposed for those vaccines that have been proven to work. To this end, Iâ\\x80\\x99m pleased to see President Biden announce that Johnson & Johnson and Merck will now form a partnership to increase vaccine production.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s also important for low- and middle-income countries to build on their domestic manufacturing capacity. Just as the yellow fever vaccine is now produced in Dakar, Senegal, an investment in manufacturing could see the same done with Covid-19 vaccines.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccinating all the world at once has never been done. But if we can put a rover on Mars, we can surely produce billions of vaccines and save lives on earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile governments and pharmaceutical groups are key to equitable vaccine rollout, everyone has a role to play. For multinational corporations that rely on trade and travel, for example, donating to Covax is the fastest way to speed up the effort to end the pandemic and get humans moving again. For individuals, especially those who have been lucky enough to be vaccinated already, you can show also your support by donating to Covax, which in itself sends a powerful message to governments that vaccine equity is the right thing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s not just about defeating Covid medically. The reality for millions of people is that this pandemic has stymied the job market and made it even harder to put food on the table. Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s development and education have stalled. These effects are as serious as the pandemic itself and a further reason why, through vaccination and other health tools, we must recover together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in terms of global security, the faster we can vaccinate, the faster we will be able to focus on fighting other threats such as the climate crisis, which has not disappeared while our attention has been consumed by the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe future is ours to write. Letâ\\x80\\x99s not be held back by politics, business as usual or those who say we canâ\\x80\\x99t. This is the biggest crisis of our lifetimes, but seeing vaccines rolling out in Ghana should only buoy our collective enthusiasm to make sure that no country is left behind. While the virus has taken advantage of our interconnectedness, we can also turn the tables by using it to spread life-saving vaccines further and faster than ever before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf not now, when?',\n",
       " 'Passionate unionist Boris Johnson must be thanking his lucky stars for the spat between the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and her predecessor, Alex Salmond. There was a sudden dip to 50-50 this week in poll support for Scottish independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I doubt if it will last. Whatever happens in the coming May elections to the Scottish parliament, the issue of independence is not going away. Once the idea takes hold of a nationâ\\x80\\x99s political soul it is never satisfied until, in some sense, it is achieved. That has been the lesson elsewhere in Europe, of Ireland, of the former nations of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Britainâ\\x80\\x99s quarter-hearted devolution in 2000 has not worked, because London could not be trusted to keep its sticky hands off the levers of central power. This week alone Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, took control of all post-pandemic subsidies, deciding who gets what aid and which industries are financed. Unpopular lockdown was devolved to Edinburgh, nice recovery is centralised to London.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson cannot deny the Scots the form of government they want, and the more he stands in its way the more they will want it. No hoary Churchillian imperial gene will stop them. The only question is what form should independence take, and how contentious and painful is the route map. The one glaring lesson we have learned from Brexit is that pompous Johnsonian rhetoric should yield to pragmatism before, rather than after, the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sensible thing now is for Downing Street to seize the initiative. It should put the ball back into Scotlandâ\\x80\\x99s court. In the likely event of an SNP victory in May, Johnson should be ready to ask with an open mind what Scotlandâ\\x80\\x99s voters really understand by independence. He should have options in his pocket, offer them for discussion and make them the basis for an eventual referendum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready London and Edinburgh are seething with constitutionalists stirring the federal pot â\\x80\\x93 most of them called Gordon Brown. The SNP is frantic to keep it simple, to be where the Brexiters were in the run-up to 2016. They assert merely that independence means independence. Yet Sturgeon herself is known to be nervous of the economic implications of a total break with London, and has reservations over extreme nationalism. Matters such as citizenship, currency, border controls, even who should be head of state are there for debate. They matter and should inform opinion before being overwhelmed by the distortions of the hustings. Again Brexit shows that naivety is not the best path to the compromises that must be reached between neighbours and friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome rule for Ireland had been under discussion for a century â\\x80\\x93 and under the Dublin parliament of 1782 even attempted. It had some support from Irish Catholic and Protestant opinion until its abolition by the Act of Union in 1800. Under Charles Stewart Parnellâ\\x80\\x99s leadership later in the 19th century, autonomy within a united kingdom might have been peacefully achieved. It was pig-headed unionist opposition in Westminster that stood in the way â\\x80\\x93 until Irish rebellion blew up in Britainâ\\x80\\x99s face. By then only republican separatism seemed feasible to the Irish. Even then, in 1922 necessity required shared citizenship and botched partition. Will Scotland go more tidily?\\r\\n\\r\\nDetails matter. My sense is that most Scots (and some Welsh) want to have similar constitutionally entrenched autonomy to that enjoyed by American states, German LÃ¤nder and Spanish autonomous regions. At present Downing Street seems petrified of granting any such delegated power and is set on the reverse. Under his Brexit deal Johnson specifically â\\x80\\x9ctook back controlâ\\x80\\x9d to London of EU powers over infrastructure, industry, farming and fisheries previously handled in Edinburgh. The story of British rule in Scotland since devolution has been of relentless centralisation. It was Margaret Thatcherâ\\x80\\x99s poll tax that finally projected the SNP from minority to majority status.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstructing a newly independent Scotland need not be as difficult as the proponents of a new â\\x80\\x9cproject fearâ\\x80\\x9d proclaim. Scottish nationalists who want full macro-economic autonomy know they must face a painful transition, one that took Ireland 50 years to travel from poverty to â\\x80\\x9cCeltic tigerâ\\x80\\x9d. That is the price of nationhood. One alternative, a federated British â\\x80\\x9chome rule for allâ\\x80\\x9d of English, Welsh and Scottish parliaments, would be harder to fashion. But such is the democratic architecture required for an era in which identity is to the fore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is what needs discussing. Scottish independence may well be unavoidable, and it will save the Tory party a deal of trouble to be its curator not its victim. That is the more reason to make it a collaborative project and, if need be, to help Scotland on its way.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

I see myself as the Theresa May in this scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing,â\\x80\\x9d I insist.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what about â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing has changed. Nothing. Has. Changed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe got Covid?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOK, youâ\\x80\\x99re quite right â\\x80\\x93 my mistake. In the middle of a pandemic for which the worldâ\\x80\\x99s immune system was completely unprepared, we caught this weird virus weâ\\x80\\x99d never had before.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see why you have to ruin everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s definitely changed â\\x80\\x93 it used to be you who ruined everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a principle here â\\x80\\x93 I remember it from a walk I went on 1,000 years ago. There is that age when your parents no longer make you go on walks and you have to decide whether you are going to go for a walk under your own steam or never walk again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a while, if you choose to go, walks seem incredibly long, like a noble test of endurance. Just going to a pub that is farther away than the nearest one makes you feel like Edmund Hillary. But then home seems a little closer on the way back, because all the waypoints are familiar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis also works on life, but not in a good way: if you stick to what is familiar, it will end up seeming very short. If we donâ\\x80\\x99t find a way to distinguish the time we just spent, it will turn into one endless day, long but short, like a dream, like waiting in an airport lounge. So, yes, some things definitely happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree weeks ago, my son became taller than me. It was preceded by endless chimpy display, during which he would claim to be taller and I would point out that he was on tiptoes, or on a stair, or wearing clogs, or I was sitting down, or he was asleep and fantasising tallness. I got so used to my watertight and routine denial that I was struck silent when it finally came to pass. This must be how Nigel Lawson felt. â\\x80\\x9cName one gas responsible for â\\x80\\x98global warmingâ\\x80\\x99! You canâ\\x80\\x99t, can you? Can you? Oh â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, he is taller. His eyes are higher. Soon, he will be able to rest a pint on my head. My thoughts gallop ahead. This makes him 5ft 10Â½in, so next he will be 6ft. Then he will be 6ft 2in. Surely he should become a model and in due course a good candidate for The Tall Man in Charge of Everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nMothers are crazy. What is wrong with us? I pester him constantly to rank himself, by tallness, against everyone at his school.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen them since October â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, though â\\x80\\x93 was there anyone who looked like they might be growing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m probably the tallest smart person.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you figure that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d he says, unveiling his point like a card sharp. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll notice I never get bullied.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November, Tesco started a promo on bulk purchases of Diet Coke, which is working out so well for them that it has not ended. This has changed the texture of our disharmony, from: â\\x80\\x9cWho finished the Diet Coke?â\\x80\\x9d to: â\\x80\\x9cTwenty-four cans in three days?! Which one of you is hiding Donald Trump and why canâ\\x80\\x99t he buy his own Diet Coke? The manâ\\x80\\x99s a billionaire!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January, I saw my neighbour in the street and told her I liked her mask. It turned out she had a spare, which she put through my door. I immediately started crying. That was new. I never cry, unless I see a dog helping another dog on the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI definitely went to the pub last July. And in August and September. In October, I got kicked out of a Wetherspoonâ\\x80\\x99s. There was surely some weather in the summer and then, particularly in January, some different weather. My birthday was the hottest it has ever been. I know this because a friend blew me out five minutes before she was due to arrive with an economical: â\\x80\\x9cI cannot be bothered.â\\x80\\x9d I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember anything, but I can hold a grudge. Good to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround Christmas, we became a nit-free household for the first time since 2009. Yesterday, my daughter played a tune on the saxophone. This came after four years of the most terrible anguished noises, like a wounded musk ox, trapped, starving, simultaneously everywhere in the house. So that was massive. I probably should have put that closer to the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here are the things that are indistinguishable from one season to the next: any day on Twitter; any point on the trajectory from Couch to 5k then back to couch; any dish involving any kind of sausage; any press conference held by any government minister; any graph comparing the UK with the rest of the world; any sentence using the words â\\x80\\x9croadmapâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cnew normalâ\\x80\\x9d. They could be this year or last year, a Saturday or a Monday; they obliterate time and transform our experience into one perpetual present, like that of a fish. You want memories; start there. Nix the sausages. Choose life. Try halloumi.',\n",
       " 'If youâ\\x80\\x99d told me at the end of 2019 â\\x80\\x93 a year I spent DJing in Mexico, the US, China and Europe â\\x80\\x93 that a total ban of clubs, live music and communal singing was imminent, I wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve told you to check your tinfoil hat. Yet here we are, almost 12 months into a global lockdown that has turned life into a modern-day Footloose, that 1980s classic set in a town where dancing is illegal â\\x80\\x93 albeit with less Kevin Bacon and more hand sanitiser.\\r\\n\\r\\nI first moved to London from a small commuter town in the Midlands aged 18, hungry for new experiences beyond the tourist traps Iâ\\x80\\x99d encountered on school trips. The decade of uninterrupted partying that followed, as both a performer and a punter, made the transition to Covid-compliant weekends in front of the TV almost welcome at first. While the disruption of an album campaign for my group, UltraÃ\\xadsta, was a huge disappointment, at least lockdown provided a break from the relentless pace of trying to balance my career, life and leisure.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I worry about the future talent that the industry is losing due to Covid-19 restrictions. If I was making that independent leap at the age of 18 now, aware of the bleak landscape that the music and nightlife industries currently face, I might well make different choices. Without an income from live performances, DJs, musicians and producers have been forced to confront the reality of the recorded music industry â\\x80\\x93 meagre streaming royalties, dwindling sales and every artist competing for the same few sync and advertising opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the pandemic, this landscape was already weighted heavily in favour of those who could afford to get ahead, either with private funding or personal contacts. But now the stakes are even higher. From the DJs behind the decks to the promoters hovering at the door, 18 months without work will prematurely end the careers of those who canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to wait out the storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nSociety is losing out too. The best nightclubs provide safe spaces for people from all walks of life. Nights out are when lifelong memories are made (or lost) and bonds formed with friends and strangers alike. The transference of energy on a packed, sweaty dancefloor is unlike anything else. On the best nights, everyone in the crowd is under the DJâ\\x80\\x99s command, their song selections determining a communal journey. This is why the concept of a socially distanced club night, which removes such spontaneity and physicality, just doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years spent performing as a singer, I released my first dance single under a new name, lau.ra, last year. Iâ\\x80\\x99d spent 2019 writing and producing a set of bass-driven tracks aimed squarely at the dancefloor, and I wanted to move people â\\x80\\x93 physically. In early 2020, I hit the ground running with a USB full of bangers and a diary full of shows. Despite my grand touring plans grinding to a spectacular halt when the first UK lockdown was announced on 23 March, I continued to release singles regularly throughout the year, with support from radio, digital streaming platforms, press and fans. On paper, at least, the launch of my new project couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have gone better.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was one crucial aspect missing. I produced this music so I could watch people connect with it. Witnessing people on a dancefloor going off to a song theyâ\\x80\\x99ve never heard that I bounced out of my studio the night before is a unique thrill, and the part of my job Iâ\\x80\\x99m missing most right now. Itâ\\x80\\x99s one thing to be told via a weekly streaming report that people are listening to your music all over the world, but itâ\\x80\\x99s not the same as witnessing it with your own eyes. I miss people. I miss that joy. And I miss dancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, live streaming has allowed musicians to perform to fans around the world without the need to physically get on a plane. From EZâ\\x80\\x99s 24-hour live-streamed DJ set in collaboration with Defected (which raised over Â£88,000 for charity), to Bicepâ\\x80\\x99s masterclass in live electronics streamed from the Saatchi Gallery, these online events have helped DJs reach new audiences who may not have previously gone to clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the physical dancefloor remains a place of wild and irreplaceable abandon. One of my first clubbing experiences was at Corsica Studios in south London after moving to the big city in 2007: bodies packed wall to wall, grotty toilets, cans of Red Stripe and bass so loud and deep it felt like my knees were about to give way. Nights in that venue made an indelible mark on my soul. We never really knew or cared who was going to be playing; we trusted the venue and walked through the doors most weekends, looking to ignite ourselves on the electricity of the evening, ready to embrace whatever twists and turns it might take.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatching a DJ play for hours on a computer screen just isnâ\\x80\\x99t as interesting. The club experience relies as much on the crowd as the music. It canâ\\x80\\x99t be replicated sitting on your tod in the living room nursing a warm rum and coke, no matter how good your headphones are. With the recent announcement of a roadmap out of lockdown, 21 June is a beacon on the horizon for many DJs, promoters and club-goers. If everything goes to plan, that day will see a reopening of the UKâ\\x80\\x99s nightclubs and event spaces. Iâ\\x80\\x99m tentatively preparing to put down the TV remote, drag myself off the sofa and dust off my dancing shoes. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see you down the front.',\n",
       " 'Two primary checks on a British prime minister are parliament and character. The countryâ\\x80\\x99s highest executive office is restrained by the legislature; the incumbentâ\\x80\\x99s actions are, ideally, conditioned by natural decency.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither has much bearing on Boris Johnson. His party has an 80-seat majority in the Commons, which means he can mostly enact legislation of his choosing. Even his friends recognise that probity and self-restraint are not dominant features of his temperament.\\r\\n\\r\\nEthical plasticity and disregard for rules were instrumental in Mr Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s career. His contempt for constitutional propriety was encapsulated in the prorogation of parliament in September 2019 because he disliked its collective views on Brexit. That renegade action was ruled unlawful by the supreme court.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s frustration around that time is the context in which to understand his governmentâ\\x80\\x99s plans to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA). The act, passed by David Cameronâ\\x80\\x99s coalition government in 2011, deprives a prime minister of the ability to call general elections at will. Technically it was a royal prerogative power. The monarch dissolved parliament on the advice of her prime minister. Now it happens if a super-majority of MPs vote for an election, or no leader can organise a majority after a no-confidence vote in the government, or when the fixed term expires.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government has published a short draft bill with proposals to restore the old system. It includes a clause to protect any dissolution decision from legal challenge and is accompanied by a single-page, non-statutory note on principles for responsibly wielding the power to dissolve (or refuse to dissolve) parliament. The prime minister should respect a vote of no confidence and avoid drawing the Queen into politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is a statement of what is sometimes called the â\\x80\\x9cgood chapsâ\\x80\\x9d model of government â\\x80\\x93 the presumption that everyone involved is a gentleman, bound by codes of honour; an aficionado of what is and isnâ\\x80\\x99t cricket when it comes to the constitution. That was an obsolete notion even before various established protocols were shot to pieces in the Brexit crossfire and before Mr Johnson brought his populist, maverick spirit to Downing Street. Even in the process of repealing the FTPA, the government is being cavalier with convention. The government has published the bill without even waiting to hear from a cross-party committee that was tasked with making recommendations for the change.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinisters argue that repeal was a Tory election pledge (mirrored also in Labourâ\\x80\\x99s manifesto), so there is an indisputable mandate for the move and no reason to expect dissent. But agreement on the principle of change does not confer licence to do it on any terms. There was much to regret in the drafting and operation of the FTPA, but also much to recommend the idea of fixed terms and of giving parliament the trigger for snap elections. That was a rare check on executive power, removing a significant advantage of incumbency. It stopped a prime minister arrogating the crown for partisan ends. Mr Johnson wants that weapon restored to his arsenal, with only his word as guarantee that it would not be abused. His word is a flimsy thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nCross-party consensus that the FTPA was flawed creates a rare opportunity for constitutional reform, which is squandered by resuscitating ancient prerogative power. Many things about the way Britain is governed need updating. It reveals something about Mr Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s character that he should choose to make a priority of this one measure â\\x80\\x93 the one that lets him play at monarchy and dissolve parliament on a whim.',\n",
       " 'After the first world war, it was said of the soldiers that they were â\\x80\\x9clions led by donkeysâ\\x80\\x9d, with the donkeys being the uncaring, inept generals responsible for thousands of frontline deaths through callousness. NHS staff lost hundreds of colleagues fighting the virus, often without adequate protective equipment. Ministers who think they only deserve a stingy 1% cash pay rise in England risk being branded Covid donkeys. After a summer when the country clapped for NHS workers, ministers today seem contemptuous of yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s heroes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is talk of strike funds being set up, raising the extraordinary prospect of a health service stopping work when the country has yet to escape the pandemic. But it represents a warning about the level of anger engendered by a decade of public sector austerity. The Royal College of Nursing says the pay of an experienced nurse has fallen by 15.3% in real terms over the past 10 years. Such a grievance may not gain much traction in the private sector, where last year workers lost jobs and had their pay cut drastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has decided public sector employees would come off worse in a dust-up over pay. Those without whom society would have ground to a halt during the pandemic arenâ\\x80\\x99t, in his eyes, worth rewarding. The million NHS staff offered a pay rise of 1% in 2021 are only part of the story. Last November, it emerged that more than 2 million public sector workers earning less than Â£24,000 will receive a rise of just Â£250 (about 1%). Another 1.3 million state employees, including those in local government and education, will have their pay frozen. More than 4 million people â\\x80\\x93 from soldiers to hospital porters â\\x80\\x93 are likely to suffer a real-terms pay cut next financial year. Essential workers deserve a proper pay rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic offered an opportunity to reset the economic model that has seen the share of wages fall as a share of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s gross domestic product. Last year, City regulators discouraged banks from paying dividends, resulting in a Â£20bn drop in such payouts. But itâ\\x80\\x99s already business as usual: investor income is expected to rise by 8% a year. By 2025, dividend levels will match the pre-pandemic record of Â£110bn. Itâ\\x80\\x99s astonishing to reflect that the government prioritised shareholder payouts instead of supporting the Covid-19 recovery. Cash when splurged appears as barely disguised sops for Tory-voting towns. By the middle of the decade, workersâ\\x80\\x99 earnings will drop, thinks the Resolution Foundation, by Â£1,200 per year compared to pre-crisis forecasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems inconceivable that Britain will spend billions less on public services than that forecast before the pandemic. Given the overhang of postponed operations, is it realistic to suggest the NHS does not need more resources and to attract more staff? The economic case for restraining public spending is a weak one. The Treasury says growth will drastically slow in 2023. It does not make sense to reduce demand when, given Covidâ\\x80\\x99s legacy, a government ought to be boosting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boxer Mike Tyson once remarked that â\\x80\\x9ceveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouthâ\\x80\\x9d. Mr Sunakâ\\x80\\x99s budget rests on a plan to spend now to deal with the pandemic, but then to recoup this outlay by raising taxes and assuming no extra post-Covid costs while cutting public spending. The chancellor is out to prove that he is, like Mr Tyson, â\\x80\\x9cIronâ\\x80\\x9d Rishi: a politician who does not brook defeat. Mr Tyson made his claim just before he lost his showdown with Evander Holyfield. Mr Sunakâ\\x80\\x99s plans are, likewise, unlikely to withstand contact with reality.',\n",

But for many school staff it may well have felt like â\\x80\\x9cBad Fridayâ\\x80\\x9d.

The virus could have a field day â\\x80\\x93 only time will tell.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a sad reflection of the low value we as a society put on education and those who are dedicated enough to deliver it.

Such outbreaks are set to continue across London, with many care home staff not being vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmerging evidence that the Covid-19 vaccine is effective against infection and transmission makes a strong case for vaccination of care home staff to be mandatory, not a choice.

Many of Scotlandâ\\x80\\x99s social democrats are finding it increasingly hard to work out why the UKâ\\x80\\x99s leading social democratic newspaper and its columnists persistently find it hard to give any recognition to a progressive, pro-European, social democratic government within these islands.

       " 'Hedge fund manager Sir Chris Hohn once made a point of telling a high court judge that he was an â\\x80\\x9cunbelievable moneymakerâ\\x80\\x9d. This week Hohn proved his point â\\x80\\x93 definitively â\\x80\\x93 when it was revealed that he paid himself just shy of Â£1m-a-day last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHohn collected $479m (Â£343m) in annual dividend payments from his The Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s Investment (TCI) fund in the biggest ever personal payday in the UK after doubling profits at his Mayfair hedge fund, run from an office a couple of doors down from Louis Vuittonâ\\x80\\x99s flagship store.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe payout â\\x80\\x93 which works out at Â£940,000 for every calendar day of the year, and is nearly 11,000 times the median UK full-time salary â\\x80\\x93 has shone a fresh spotlight on Hohn, a billionaire who goes to extraordinary lengths to protect his privacy after receiving regular death threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as making money and picking boardroom fights, Hohn, who was once chancellor Rishi Sunakâ\\x80\\x99s boss at TCI, is one of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s biggest philanthropists.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has pumped more than Â£4bn into his personal childrenâ\\x80\\x99s charity. And in recent years he has taken on a second cause: the climate crisis, promising to use his fundâ\\x80\\x99s $30bn of investments to â\\x80\\x9cforce change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriouslyâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell known in the City and on Wall Street as one of the most aggressive activist investors, it came as little surprise to Hohnâ\\x80\\x99s friends that he was not prepared to wait for governments to take action on climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Extinction Rebellion protest by the elderly in London 2019. Chris Hohn is the groupâ\\x80\\x99s biggest donor. Photograph: Richard Baker/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead he has pumped money into Extinction Rebellion (XR), the â\\x80\\x9crespectful disruptionâ\\x80\\x9d campaign that has staged high-profile sit-in protests around the world. When Hohn was revealed as XRâ\\x80\\x99s single biggest donor, he said: â\\x80\\x9cHumanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHohn, who has only given a handful of tightly controlled media interviews throughout his career, pleaded with the high court judge overseeing his 2014 divorce from Jamie Cooper-Hohn to ban the media from the courtroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever the request was denied, giving the public a glimpse into the billionaireâ\\x80\\x99s surprisingly modest lifestyle, his motivations for making so much money, and why he didnâ\\x80\\x99t view his wife of 17 years as worthy of half the family fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough he was in a fight over a huge amount of money, Hohn said his lifeâ\\x80\\x99s mission was to give money away. â\\x80\\x9cMy life is actually about charity,â\\x80\\x9d he told the court. â\\x80\\x9cI learned very early on you cannot take money with you. It does not bring you happiness.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said he lived a â\\x80\\x9cvery simple lifestyleâ\\x80\\x9d, avoids meat and practises yoga. On hearing the evidence, the judge noted that the couple lived a â\\x80\\x9cSwatch lifestyleâ\\x80\\x9d not a â\\x80\\x9cjet-set lifestyleâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHohn grew up in Addlestone, Surrey, the son of a Jamaican car mechanic and a legal secretary. He first decided to give money to charity, he has said, while working in the Philippines, where as a 20-year-old he saw children living on a rubbish dump.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI considered being a doctor and working in a caring profession,â\\x80\\x9d Hohn, 54, told the court. â\\x80\\x9c[But] a dream or aspiration without resources is just that.â\\x80\\x9d He compared his ambition to become a philanthropist to other young people who set their hearts on being able to â\\x80\\x9cplay for Chelsea or be a top QCâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHohn studied accounting and economics at Southampton University, where a tutor suggested he go on to study for a masters in business administration at Harvard. He took their advice, and graduated in the top 5% of his class.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at a Harvard dinner party that Hohn met Jamie Cooper, who was studying for a masters at the John F Kennedy School of government. They married soon after and took each otherâ\\x80\\x99s names officially, but only Jamie used both surnames. They have four children, including a set of triplets.\\r\\n\\r\\nHohn worked for the private equity firm Apax Partners, before moving to the Wall Street hedge fund Perry Capital. Perryâ\\x80\\x99s partners then posted him back to London where he ran the UK division.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe struck out on his own in 2003 setting up his own $500m fund TCI, which quickly attracted investment from some of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s top foundations and endowments including the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nJamie Cooper-Hohn leaves the high court after a divorce hearing in 2014. It was one of the most high profile divorces in British legal history.

One opponent â\\x80\\x93 former Deutsche BÃ¶rse boss Werner Seifert â\\x80\\x93 was so angry after losing a boardroom battle with Hohn that he wrote a book about it entitled Invasion of the Locusts, where he described Hohnâ\\x80\\x99s style as â\\x80\\x9cpoisonâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHohnâ\\x80\\x99s TCI was also instrumental in forcing Dutch bank ABN Amro into the arms of Royal Bank of Scotland in 2007 â\\x80\\x93 a deal which just months later, when the banking crisis hit, was a key reason RBS had to be bailed out by the UK taxpayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nCooper-Hohn said the foundation â\\x80\\x9cnot about putting a warm and fuzzy faceâ\\x80\\x9d on TCI. She said knowing that a share of the management fees went to the fund was â\\x80\\x9cvery much about keeping Chris motivatedâ\\x80\\x9d to produce the highest returns possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth TCI and the foundation flourished. The hedge fund now manages $30bn of investments and is regularly listed among the worldâ\\x80\\x99s best-performing funds. Last yearâ\\x80\\x99s mega payday was not that exceptional for Hohn. The previous year he was paid Â£200m, and accounts filed at Companies House for TCI Fund Management (UK) Limited, which is 100% owned by Hohn, show that it holds total shareholder funds of almost $2bn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charity holds almost $6bn of assets and gave away $386m in 2019, according to the latest available accounts. However, the foundation no longer collects one-third of TCIâ\\x80\\x99s management fees, following the coupleâ\\x80\\x99s divorce. Instead, Hohn can give to the charity at his discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe divorce reached the high court after Hohn refused to give Cooper-Hohn half of their assets, arguing that the extraordinary wealth he had generated constituted a special contribution to the marriage. He claimed she was only entitled to 25%.\\r\\n\\r\\nSign up to the daily Business Today email\\r\\n\\r\\nHer lawyer said the marriage was â\\x80\\x9cwhat most marriages are: a partnership. How can it be possibly be fair that a couple who have agreed how to run their lives together for the wife to only receive a quarter of the assets?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter weeks of arguments â\\x80\\x93 which included Hohn calling Goldman Sachs bankers â\\x80\\x9cidiotsâ\\x80\\x9d and describing former Spain and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres as â\\x80\\x9cworthlessâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 the judge awarded Cooper-Hohn 36% â\\x80\\x93 or $530m â\\x80\\x93 of her former husbandâ\\x80\\x99s fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nCooper-Hohn later won another court battle forcing Hohnâ\\x80\\x99s CIFF charity to pay Â£270m to a charity set up by his ex-wife.',\n",

It will give builders, developers and owners â\\x80\\x9crisk ownershipâ\\x80\\x9d for overall safety rather than the current system of relying on signoff by a building inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt follows a post-Grenfell review of building safety by Dame Judith Hackitt. The Health and Safety Executive will hire 700 staff including fire experts and engineers to vet buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new national watchdog for England will have to check projects at three key stages: planning approval, start of construction and handover. If it is not satisfied, it can stop works. The system takes control out of the hands of councils. The Grenfell Tower inquiry heard that the local councilâ\\x80\\x99s building inspector was overwhelmed with work after cuts, with 130 jobs on at the time of the high-rise project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public inquiry has also heard how architects, builders and clients engaged in â\\x80\\x9ca merry-go-round of buck-passingâ\\x80\\x9d on safety that allowed highly combustible materials to be used and mistakes to be made in construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaker said the new system would â\\x80\\x9cmake it much more difficult for organisations to duck and dive, dodge and weave and use contractual arrangements to pass the buck.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA parallel inspectorate for construction products is also being set up. There have been revelations at the inquiry that manufacturers gamed testing and certification systems to obtain approvals for dangerous materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA measure of our success will be the absence of these sorts of disasters,â\\x80\\x9d Baker said. â\\x80\\x9cIndustry needs to get on with this and anticipate whatâ\\x80\\x99s coming. We are not shy of taking enforcement action and we will do that from day one if necessary.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said the public had â\\x80\\x9clost complete confidence in the construction industryâ\\x80\\x99s ability to build safe and good-quality buildingsâ\\x80\\x9d, and he told the industry: â\\x80\\x9cYou need to get your act together.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said his intent was to â\\x80\\x9cgive residents confidence this new regulatory regime is going to prevent this sort of issue arising againâ\\x80\\x9d.',\n",
       " 'A man who was prevented from returning home to the UK for nine years by the Windrush scandal has been refused British citizenship because of his protracted absence from the country â\\x80\\x93 despite an acknowledgment from the home secretary that the government was to blame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case highlights the Home Officeâ\\x80\\x99s failure to provide justice to some of those affected, almost three years since ministers first promised to right the wrongs caused by the immigration scandal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor Donald, 65, received a letter from Priti Patel in which she expressed her regret that the rigidity of immigration legislation means he cannot be granted British citizenship. The law requires applicants to have been physically present in the UK for the majority of the five years preceding their application.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald said the latest refusal was ridiculous and painful, and expressed anger at the continued precariousness of his situation. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a blow. They should have rectified the situation years ago,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe way the system has been treating me and people like me is wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald was stranded in Jamaica for nine years after travelling there to attend his motherâ\\x80\\x99s funeral in 2010. At that point he had been in Britain for 43 years, since arriving as an 11-year-old child to live in Birmingham, legally, in 1967. He was entitled to citizenship but applied formally for leave to remain only when his mother became ill and he needed to get a passport so he could visit her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis application was unsuccessful because he did not have enough evidence to prove he had lived in the UK for more than four decades. His mother died before he was granted a passport but he travelled to the funeral using emergency documents, having been reassured by a Home Office official that he would be allowed to re-enter the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he was denied permission to return later that year. He was only allowed back nine years later, in 2019, when Home Office staff working for the Windrush taskforce contacted him, apologised and paid for him to fly home to Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said he was disappointed that his recent application for British citizenship had been refused. â\\x80\\x9cThey told me the law says I should be here for five years before my application but itâ\\x80\\x99s not my fault I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t here,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He is not the only person affected by this problem. Ken Morgan described being caught in a â\\x80\\x9cridiculous catch-22â\\x80\\x9d last year when he too was refused citizenship because of his prolonged absence, also the result of British officials mistakenly refusing him entry back into the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatel wrote to Donald to say that the injustice he experienced was â\\x80\\x9cshamefulâ\\x80\\x9d but added that the British Nationality Act of 1981 had a â\\x80\\x9cstrict and immovable requirementâ\\x80\\x9d to be in the UK five years before applying for British citizenship.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor your current application to succeed you would have needed to be in the UK on 17 April 2015. I fully recognise your absence from the United Kingdom on that date was not of your choice and I appreciate how frustrating this must be. It is with deep regret that we are constrained by the parameters of the existing legislation,â\\x80\\x9d she wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was in Jamaica, Donald was unable to work, had no money, and lived in an abandoned house, which had no electricity, water, no glass in the windows and no doors in the doorways. The former decorator had to walk a mile to draw water from a well and cooked his food on an open fire in the street. He was separated from his six children in the UK and the prolonged absence has caused permanent damage to family ties in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was terrible,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cI felt like a foreigner in Jamaica; I lost everything while I was there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe then home secretary, Sajid Javid, wrote to Donald in 2018 to apologise for the Home Officeâ\\x80\\x99s treatment of him. Javid said: â\\x80\\x9cIn its handling of your case, the department should have demonstrated more flexibility, common sense and empathy. I wish to assure that the Home Office is making sure lessons have been learned and changes are being made to the approach it takes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Donaldâ\\x80\\x99s lawyer, Connie Sozi, said the department was still not demonstrating flexibility. â\\x80\\x9cThe injustice continues, and this was the Home Officeâ\\x80\\x99s fault. This is a process that was supposed to rectify the wrongs so why is he being asked to fulfil requirements that he is unable to fulfil because he was wrongly prevented from returning?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald has been granted indefinite leave to remain and can stay in the UK until rules allow him to reapply for citizenship sometime after May 2023.

       " 'The Salmond inquiry is having a significant impact on the momentum for change brought about by the #MeToo movement, according to experts and campaigners on workplace harassment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have told the Guardian the political crisis convulsing Holyrood has also had a â\\x80\\x9cchillingâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cdemoralisingâ\\x80\\x9d effect on women in terms of their confidence in reporting unacceptable behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Salmond by two female civil servants was found to be both unlawful and â\\x80\\x9ctainted by apparent biasâ\\x80\\x9d following a judicial review brought by the former first minister in January 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year later he was acquitted of 13 charges of sexual assault at the high court in Edinburgh and since then he has claimed that senior officials close to the current first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, were involved in a â\\x80\\x9cmalicious plotâ\\x80\\x9d to destroy his reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith two high-profile investigations ongoing into the Scottish governmentâ\\x80\\x99s handling of the initial complaints and Sturgeonâ\\x80\\x99s own conduct, concerns have been growing about the wider impact on women.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sturgeon gave her evidence to the Holyrood inquiry on Wednesday, she placed her governmentâ\\x80\\x99s decision to create a new procedure to deal with sexual harassment firmly within the global context of #MeToo, the movement driven by shocking revelations about the US film producer Harvey Weinstein in autumn 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her opening remarks to the committee, Sturgeon said: â\\x80\\x9cThe spotlight shone on historic workplace harassment in late 2017 was long overdue.â\\x80\\x9d And when she was later challenged on Salmondâ\\x80\\x99s contention that the new policy had been expanded to apply to former ministers with Salmond in mind, she responded: â\\x80\\x9cTo see it in that way ignores what was happening globally at the time. It was about the #MeToo revelations.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the momentum that built from 2017 may have forced individual employers to review their policies, how those work in practice depends on the wider cultural context, said Kirsty Thomson, the director of Just Right Scotland, a charitable group of human rights lawyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is playing out at the moment with the Salmond inquiry is having a really significant impact. From what we hear, it is having a chilling effect,â\\x80\\x9d said Thomson, who also leads the legal team at the Scottish Womenâ\\x80\\x99s Rights Centre, which offers free legal advice to women affected by violence and abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAny organisation can say â\\x80\\x98here is a harassment policyâ\\x80\\x99, but someone has to feel confident to use it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRoz Foyer, the general secretary of the STUC, expressed similar concerns. She said: â\\x80\\x9cMy biggest fear is that the way we are discussing this inquiry is not encouraging more women to come forward or stand up to inappropriate behaviour in the future.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReferencing TUC research that found that more than half of women in the UK had experienced sexual harassment at work while four-fifths did not feel able to report it, she said she had heard in particular from younger women in recent days â\\x80\\x9cabout the fact that [the Salmond inquiry] is a very triggering experience for themâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs someone whose own activism comes from a formative experience of sexual harassment in the workplace [Foyer was harassed by a senior male manager when she was 17] I certainly can empathise. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very demoralising experience to see the way that this whole matter has been responded to and dealt with by ultimately the people in power. There is a lot of party politicking going on but not a lot of constructive engagement around the fact that women experiencing harassment at work is something thatâ\\x80\\x99s endemic across society and has to stop.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe momentum around #MeToo was felt as powerfully in Scotland as it was internationally, said Nicole Busby, professor in human rights, equality and justice at the University of Glasgow. â\\x80\\x9cI saw it speaking to the young women I teach, and that growing recognition that sexual harassment can happen to anyone, itâ\\x80\\x99s very much to do with power and that it is unacceptable. That was a shift from women of my generation who had tolerated it for years.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBusby, who has a particular specialism in harassment tribunal work, said she â\\x80\\x9ccannot stress enoughâ\\x80\\x9d the importance of retrospective policies such as the policy that the Scottish government formulated in 2017. â\\x80\\x9cTribunals are usually quite flexible about timelines because they recognise that victims can be traumatised or it is too difficult to take action at the time because of the power dynamics involved.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public discussion around the inquiry had been unhelpful, said Emma Ritch, the head of Scotlandâ\\x80\\x99s feminist policy organisation Engender, accentuating confusion around the difference between criminal law and sexual harassment policy as well as bolstering myths about the likelihood of women making false allegations.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a widespread sense from women who talk to us that this has been exceptionally offputting and even re-traumatising to women who have been sexually harassed. One of the things women are most attuned to when making complaints is the prospect of losing control over the process. What has happened with the Salmond inquiry has magnified this: that you could find yourself at the centre of a national scandal, where people feel free to impugn your motives and everything you want to talk about becomes about party politics or the constitution.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Foyer, the formula for change remains both practical and cultural. She said: â\\x80\\x9cWe need robust independent procedures that women can have confidence in. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s down to every employer to take responsibility for, but we can all do more. As trade unions, we have a role to ensure this issue is being addressed, politicians have a role in how they talk about cases like this and the prominence they give to the root causes, and the media have a role to play as well.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

The report noted that while every LGBT person had a right to take part in the parade, not every organisation shared that right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe community advisory board has previously criticised Pride in London for not being inclusive enough, with Stonewall pulling out of the parade in 2018 because of the eventâ\\x80\\x99s perceived lack of diversity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the run-up to the vote, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, wrote to the board urging it to allow her force to be able to participate in the procession.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the letter, seen exclusively by the Guardian, Britainâ\\x80\\x99s most senior police officer wrote: â\\x80\\x9cFor us, Pride in London is something we have been proud to be at the centre of.

Many were clear that exclusion would be the best way to show solidarity.

       " 'Pope Francis has had a symbolic meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, one of the most senior clerics in Shia Islam, in Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s holy city of Najaf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historic meeting in Sistaniâ\\x80\\x99s home was months in the making, with every detail painstakingly discussed and negotiated between the ayatollahâ\\x80\\x99s office and the Vatican.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came, the 84-year-old pontiffâ\\x80\\x99s convoy, led by a bullet-proof vehicle, pull up along Najafâ\\x80\\x99s narrow and column-lined Rasool Street, which culminates at the golden-domed Imam Ali Shrine, one of the most revered sites in the world for Shia. He then walked the few metres to Sistaniâ\\x80\\x99s modest home, which the cleric has rented for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of Iraqis wearing traditional clothes welcomed him outside. As a masked Francis entered the doorway a few white doves were released in a sign of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closed-door meeting was to touch on issues plaguing Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s Christian minority. Sistani is a deeply revered figure in Shia-majority Iraq and and his opinions on religious and other matters are sought by Shia worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s dwindling Christian minority a show of solidarity from Sistani could help secure their place in Iraq after years of displacement â\\x80\\x94 and, they hope, ease intimidation from Shia militiamen against their community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visit was carried live on Iraqi television and residents cheered the meeting of two respected faith leaders. â\\x80\\x9cWe welcome the popeâ\\x80\\x99s visit to Iraq and especially to the holy city of Najaf and his meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani,â\\x80\\x9d said Najaf resident Haidar Al-Ilyawi. â\\x80\\x9cIt is an historic visit and hope it will be good for Iraq and the Iraqi people.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pope arrived in Baghdad for the first ever papal visit to Iraq amid tight security and concerns about the impact of his trip on rising Covid infection rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis presence was â\\x80\\x9ca duty towards a land that has been martyred for so many yearsâ\\x80\\x9d, Francis said shortly before landing. A Vatican spokesperson said the trip was â\\x80\\x9can act of love to a country that has suffered terribly over recent decadesâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite worries about the risks of his visit amid rising Covid rates in Iraq, a largely unmasked choir sang as Francis was greeted by the Iraqi prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi. Both men removed their face masks, shook hands and spoke sitting less than 2 metres apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 84-year-old pope, his entourage and 75 media representatives travelling with the Vatican delegation have been vaccinated against Covid, but most Iraqis have not.\\r\\n\\r\\nHundreds of people had gathered along the airport road with hopes of catching a glimpse of the popeâ\\x80\\x99s plane touching down. Billboards showing Francis with the slogan â\\x80\\x9cWe are all brothersâ\\x80\\x9d are on display in central Baghdad, and Iraqi and Vatican flags are lining streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity has been increased during the visit, said Tahsin al-Khafaji, the spokesperson for Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s joint operations. â\\x80\\x9cThe whole world will be watching,â\\x80\\x9d he said. The high stakes will give Iraqi forces â\\x80\\x9cmotivation to achieve this visit with safety and peaceâ\\x80\\x9d, he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of his customary open-sided popemobile, Francis is travelling in an armoured car, as well as making longer journeys between regions by plane and helicopter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vatican and Iraqi authorities have played down the threat of Covid and insisted that social distancing, crowd control and other healthcare measures will be enforced.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a meeting with Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s president, Barham Salih, inside the heavily fortified Green Zone, Francis said Iraqis of all faiths deserved to have the same rights and protections as the Shia Muslim majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said: â\\x80\\x9cOnly if we learn to look beyond our differences and see each other as members of the same human family will we be able to begin an effective process of rebuilding and leave to future generations a better, more just and more humane world.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe added: â\\x80\\x9cThe age-old presence of Christians in this land, and their contributions to the life of the nation, constitute a rich heritage that they wish to continue to place at the service of all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancis called for an end to â\\x80\\x9cacts of violence and extremism, factions and intoleranceâ\\x80\\x9d and urged Iraqi officials to â\\x80\\x9ccombat the scourge of corruption, misuse of power and disregard for lawâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalih said it was â\\x80\\x9cimpossible to imagine the Middle East without Christiansâ\\x80\\x9d and that their continued migration would have dire consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater the pope addressed the faithful at the Our Lady of Salvation church in Baghdadâ\\x80\\x99s commercial Karrada district, where attendance was restricted to enable social distancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 Islamist militants stormed the church and killed 44 worshippers, two priests and several security force personnel in one of the bloodiest attacks on Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s Christians.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancis thanked his fellow clergy for remaining close to Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s beleaguered Christians, who he said had paid â\\x80\\x9cthe ultimate price of their fidelity to the Lord and his churchâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pope was also due honour the dead in a Mosul square surrounded by shells of destroyed churches and meet Christians who have returned to the town of Qaraqosh â\\x80\\x93 as well as blessing their church, which was used as a firing range by Isis.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Christians fled when Isis militants swept through towns across the Nineveh plains in 2014, destroying churches and homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few who have returned have struggled to find work, with many blaming discriminatory practices in the public sector, Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s largest employer. Since 2003 public jobs have been mostly controlled by majority Shia political elites, leaving Christians feeling marginalised.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were an estimated 1.4 million Christians in Iraq before the US-led invasion in 2003, but now the number is believed to be about 250,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nFuad Hussein, Iraqâ\\x80\\x99s foreign minister, said Iraqis were eager to welcome Francisâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cmessage of peace and toleranceâ\\x80\\x9d and described the visit as a historic meeting between the â\\x80\\x9cminaret and the bellsâ\\x80\\x9d.',\n",

       " 'Irish authorities have announced plans to fly unweaned dairy calves from Ireland to other EU destinations from May, in an effort to address growing unease about the length of the journeys made by thousands of animals shipped each year to mainland Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish government has been subject to sustained scrutiny over live calf exports and the decision to experiment with flights, which will significantly cut travel time, comes as a European parliament committee of inquiry examines alleged failures across Europe in enforcing rules on protecting transported animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrelandâ\\x80\\x99s 1.6 million dairy herd is ever-expanding and the country is grappling with increasing numbers of calves born each spring. About 750,000 male dairy calves are born each year. Most are sold into the domestic beef sector, but approximately 30,000 are slaughtered, while 200,000 are earmarked for live export by road and sea for veal production on the continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the fate of these 200,000 calves â\\x80\\x93 some transported at 14 days of age â\\x80\\x93 that is of increasing concern to Irish authorities, amid continued criticism from animal welfare campaigners who claim the rules governing calf transport are routinely flouted. They say Irish calves have experienced â\\x80\\x9cnightmare journeysâ\\x80\\x9d without access to water or food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch government has continued to push for an EU-wide ban on journeys over eight hours for all unweaned animals. The Guardian has learned that the Dutch agriculture minister has communicated to the countryâ\\x80\\x99s veal calf industry that it should â\\x80\\x9csharply reduce and eventually stopâ\\x80\\x9d all imports of calves from faraway farms. The Netherlands is a key export market for Irelandâ\\x80\\x99s unweaned calves.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98We want to see calves flying out of this countryâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x93 Tim Cullinan, president of the Irish Farmersâ\\x80\\x99 Association. Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nFarming groups have welcomed the air trial. â\\x80\\x9cWe want to see calves flying out of this country,â\\x80\\x9d the president of the Irish Farmersâ\\x80\\x99 Association, Tim Cullinan, told the Irish parliament in December. He said while the cost of flying is double that of sea transport, flights would also enable the industry to reach new markets. But some campaigners strongly oppose the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFlying calves sounds horrific,â\\x80\\x9d said Caroline Rowley of Ethical Farming Ireland, a nonprofit organisation she founded in 2019. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand the logistics. Itâ\\x80\\x99s still going to be a long journey of turning up to the airport, unloading calves from trucks into pens. Itâ\\x80\\x99s noisy in the plane â\\x80\\x93 thereâ\\x80\\x99s air pressure changes and turbulence. Flying them is avoiding the fundamental issue: we are producing too many animals.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIreland fearful of EU ban on calf exports\\r\\n\\r\\nThe search for new markets cited by farmers â\\x80\\x93 inside and outside Europe â\\x80\\x93 is now more urgent because the Dutch agriculture minister, Carola Schouten, is putting pressure on the veal industry to stop buying calves that have undergone long journeys.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have concerns regarding the welfare of these vulnerable animals during these long journeys,â\\x80\\x9d said her spokesperson, Raoel Koole. â\\x80\\x9cThe veal calf industry in the Netherlands should not be dependent on these imports.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTeagasc, Irelandâ\\x80\\x99s state agency for agri-food research, is leading the project to fly calves out of the country and it is thought the first plane-load will leave in May. The publicly-funded â\\x82¬1.2m (Â£1m) project, called â\\x80\\x9cMooveâ\\x80\\x9d, will include an assessment of calf welfare as the animals are transported on planes and ferries, and it will also examine the potential of slow-release nutrition that can mimic feeding over a long period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish governmentâ\\x80\\x99s 2010 expansion plan encouraged farmers to grow and intensify their dairy enterprises. While the average price paid to farmers for milk is near the bottom of the international league and has not changed much in relative terms for more than two decades, many parts of the dairy industry have boomed in the past decade and herd size and milk output have shot up.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the authorities have faced criticism for an apparent lack of oversight regarding calf welfare, and the Moove project is seen as a way to rebalance the paucity of data.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 200,000 male calves each year are earmarked for live export from Ireland for veal production. Photograph: L214/Eyes on Animals\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe want to put a baseline on the welfare, compared to welfare of calves that wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be travelling,â\\x80\\x9d said Pat Dillon, who leads Teagascâ\\x80\\x99s animal research centre in Fermoy, County Cork, and is overseeing the five-year project.\\r\\n\\r\\nEU law states that calves should not travel longer than eight hours and while this suits mainland Europeâ\\x80\\x99s veal industry, travel from Ireland takes much longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn exemption was written into EU legislation in 2005. Calves exported from Ireland must rest for 12 hours after unloading at the port of destination â\\x80\\x93 in Irelandâ\\x80\\x99s case usually Cherbourg, France. This still leaves the problem of feeding them along the way, and welfare groups argue that because the journey is so long, calves go without sufficient feed for lengthy periods, contravening the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalves â\\x80\\x98floodingâ\\x80\\x99 the market in spring\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Teagasc dairy model further complicates the problem. The compact spring calving system means a glut of calves are born within a six to eight-week period from February to April. Farmers are advised to practise so-called â\\x80\\x9csnatch calvingâ\\x80\\x9d, where offspring are removed from their mothers within an hour of birth. They are also told to sell the bull calves â\\x80\\x9cas soon as possibleâ\\x80\\x9d. This sudden flush of thousands of calves can drive down prices; in 2019, bull calves reportedly sold for less than 50 cents (43p) each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has caused a headache for live exporters. â\\x80\\x9cThe six-week calving pattern is flooding the market,â\\x80\\x9d said John Hallissey, secretary of the Irish Livestock Exporters Association. â\\x80\\x9cThere are too many calves coming at once â\\x80\\x93 if that period was spread out, it would help the situation. Ideally, calves should be that bit older and stronger to take the journey â\\x80\\x93 the best environment for the calf to grow is being fed new milk in the farm of origin for 21 days.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCalves leaving the barn for the first time in West Cork. Animal welfare groups have said the flight plan wonâ\\x80\\x99t solve the problem of â\\x80\\x98too many animalsâ\\x80\\x99 being born. Photograph: aphperspective/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nHallissey said it is in exportersâ\\x80\\x99 best interests that calves arrive at their destination in good condition. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s what we get paid for,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cCalves are travelling well by road and are being well looked after.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking to the European parliamentâ\\x80\\x99s committee of inquiry in February, Rob Doyle, a civil servant in Irelandâ\\x80\\x99s agriculture department, admitted that while there are gaps in scientific knowledge in relation to live animal transportation, the argument about journey times should be about data rather than about distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is vital that this debate is based in objective evidence and scientific research, rather than conducted around subjective opinions on social media,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe banning of live export would have consequences that would require significant management back on the farms in Ireland.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

       " 'China has set out an economic blueprint for the next five years that could lead to a strong rise in greenhouse gas emissions if further action is not taken to meet the countryâ\\x80\\x99s long-term goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 14th five-year plan, published in Beijing on Friday, gave few details on how the worldâ\\x80\\x99s biggest emitter would meet its target of reaching net zero emissions by 2060, set out by President Xi Jinping last year, and of ensuring that carbon dioxide output peaks before 2030.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina will reduce its â\\x80\\x9cemissions intensityâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 the amount of CO 2 produced per unit of GDP â\\x80\\x93 by 18% over the period 2021 to 2025, but this target is in line with previous trends, and could lead to emissions continuing to increase by 1% a year or more. Non-fossil fuel energy is targeted to make up 20% of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s energy mix, leaving plenty of room for further expansion of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s coal industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwithin Lui, of the Climate Action Tracker and NewClimate Institute, said: â\\x80\\x9c[This is] underwhelming and shows little sign of a concerted switch away from a future coal lock-in. There is little sign of the change needed [to meet net zero].â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nZhang Shuwei, chief economist at Draworld Environment Research Centre, said: â\\x80\\x9cAs the first five-year plan after China committed to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, the 14th five-year plan was expected to demonstrate strong climate ambition. However, the draft plan presented does not seem to meet the expectations. The international community expected Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s climate policy to â\\x80\\x98jumpâ\\x80\\x99, but in reality it is still crawling.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUnusually, this five-year plan did not set out GDP targets for the whole five-year period, but allowed for annual targets, with the first for this year a target of 6% growth. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said that coupled with the emissions intensity target, this could allow the growth rate of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s emissions to speed up even further, rather than slow down, as is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, however, still scope for China to flesh out its plan with more detail on how it will increase clean energy generation, encourage industry to reduce emissions, and to adopt more stringent near-term targets on greenhouse gas emissions. Sectoral plans and other details will follow later this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBernice Lee, research director for futures at Chatham House, said the five-year plan should be seen as a starting point. â\\x80\\x9cXi has staked his political capital and future on delivering green and low-carbon growth at home, and his international reputation on fast climate action,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cThe direction of travel is clear, even if it remains short on specifics. The announcement [of the five-year plan] is just the start of a marathon, not a sprint. There will be much to play for in the coming months.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill to come is Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s national plan under the Paris climate agreement. This November, world governments will meet in Glasgow for vital UN climate talks, called Cop26. Under the Paris agreement, countries were supposed to set out in 2020 fresh commitments on cutting or curbing emissions between now and 2030. That timetable slipped because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the UN has made it clear it wants new national plans for 2030 â\\x80\\x93 called nationally determined contributions, or NDCs â\\x80\\x93 from all major countries before Cop26.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EU, the UK, Japan and about 70 others have set out their NDCs, though some are under pressure to revise them. China and the US, the worldâ\\x80\\x99s biggest economies, have yet to submit theirs. Joe Biden, the US president, has called a summit of world leaders for 22 April to discuss the climate emergency, at which he is expected to unveil his countryâ\\x80\\x99s NDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany US climate experts and civil society groups think Biden should target a halving of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, which they said would be an achievable target for the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor China, the biggest question is whether the NDC will set a year for peaking emissions that is sooner than the 2030 target date that Xi set out last September. If emissions are allowed to grow until 2030, that could jeopardise the Paris goals, of holding global heating to well below 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below a 1.5C increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts and campaigners are hoping that China will set a peak year of 2025, which would help ensure that the Paris goals remained within reach. Li Shuo, policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia, said: â\\x80\\x9cPeaking emissions earlier than 2025 is not only possible but necessary. Pumping the brake on emissions progressively harder is good for Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s economic transformation and will help Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s global image.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

It recommends a new way of responding that the scientists call the â\\x80\\x9c3Asâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 short for improved awareness of the value of ecosystems, better anticipation of risks and rapid action to reduce them.\\r\\n\\r\\nProf Lesley Hughes, an ecologist, pro-vice-chancellor (research) at Macquarie University and one of the paperâ\\x80\\x99s 38 authors, says many of the ecosystems are at a tipping point. For some, the change come abruptly â\\x80\\x93 in a matter of weeks or months â\\x80\\x93 but for others there was a slow decline over decades, or longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe other message to take from this is simply the breadth of it,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s important we understand this is not just the Great Barrier Reef. These are ecosystems that go from the wet tropics to Antarctica, and many in between.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most shocking examples of collapse in the past couple of decades are the near freefall decline of sub-alpine forests across NSW and Victoria, where fires are now too frequent for the species to seed and grow, and the disappearance of Tasmaniaâ\\x80\\x99s once omnipresent giant kelp forests due to marine heatwaves and the arrival of urchins that thrive in warmer waters. The best-known example is the unprecedented three mass bleaching events to hit the Great Barrier Reef in just five years, causing significant coral death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese stories are simultaneously familiar and absent in the Australian political and media discussion â\\x80\\x93 referenced, but mostly not treated seriously enough to justify elevating to alongside the economy or defence as a matter of national importance. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just the environment, after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientists say this lack of national focus fails to grasp not only the intrinsic value of the ecosystems in their own right, but their vital importance to human wellbeing and survival. The ecosystems in collapse provide water and food and support livelihoods across the continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper explains that the ecosystems are collapsing due to both chronic pressures and acute â\\x80\\x9cpulsesâ\\x80\\x9d that come and go in a rush.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the thousands of spectacled flying foxes who succumbed to heat stress near Cairns.

In the case of the spectacled flying fox, habitat loss and an underlying 1C average temperature increase over the past century were squeezing the species, long before an extreme heat spike caused an overnight disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nHughes says coral reef bleaching and the mass fish kill at Menindee Lakes were other examples of cases where â\\x80\\x9cthere has been an underlying threat bubbling along for a long period of time and then a sudden brutal event tips things overâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr Justine Shaw, a conservation ecologist with the University of Queensland and one of the initiators of the research, suggests it is a disaster that has been building in plain sight â\\x80\\x93 that while the abrupt catastrophes were alarming, â\\x80\\x9cif you talk to the scientists who work in the area, in most cases they were not really surprisedâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientistsâ\\x80\\x99 diagnosis is broadly consistent with other studies and reports to government, including the 2017 state of the environment report and the review of national environment laws by the former competition watchdog chief Graeme Samuel. Both stress that Australiaâ\\x80\\x99s natural heritage is in sharp decline and urgent change is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the latest report differs from previous major government reports is its depth â\\x80\\x93 it goes beyond a helicopter assessment and looks at what is happening within ecosystems.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia has a famously poor record in species protection, a point reinforced by government data released this week that again confirmed it has the worldâ\\x80\\x99s worst mammalian extinction rate. More than 10% of land mammals have been lost since European colonisation. The number of species of all types at risk is expected to have vaulted after last yearâ\\x80\\x99s catastrophic bushfires, in which it is estimated nearly 3bn animals were killed or affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientists who spoke to Guardian Australia stress that while there is rightly a focus on species loss, ecosystems â\\x80\\x93 the complex webs of interdependent species within a specific environment â\\x80\\x93 are harder to recover when they begin to decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nProf Brendan Wintle, a conservation biologist at the University of Melbourne and the director of the government-backed Threatened Species Recovery Hub, says public consciousness and was more attuned to threatened species â\\x80\\x93 things with fur, faces and characters â\\x80\\x93 than to entire ecosystems, but the reportâ\\x80\\x99s attention to those ecosystems was welcome and needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTasmaniaâ\\x80\\x99s giant kelp forests have been hit by marine heatwaves. Photograph: Thomas Schmitt/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nHe expects the focus will increasingly shift from protecting species to ecosystems in the years ahead for a simple reason: â\\x80\\x9cWe will start to see more concern towards collapsing ecosystems because it represents an existential risk to us.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists say monitoring of ecosystem health is almost non-existent, due in part to a lack of funding. Developments are generally approved on an individual basis, rather than the cumulative impact on whole ecosystems being considered. They say too little has been done to find ways to deliver the things humans need â\\x80\\x93 housing and water and food â\\x80\\x93 in a way that maintains the natural systems that sustain them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHughes says ecosystems are being hit by â\\x80\\x9cmulti-scaled problems that need multi-scaled solutionsâ\\x80\\x9d. â\\x80\\x9cDealing with just one at a time doesnâ\\x80\\x99t address the problem,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cYou need to deal with all of them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper doesnâ\\x80\\x99t overplay how easy it is to do this but focuses on what could be achieved. It starts from a simple principle: in many cases â\\x80\\x93 and particularly for high-profile examples including the Great Barrier Reef and the Murray-Darling basin â\\x80\\x93 the solutions are known.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report gives examples where there have been positive responses after catastrophic events. In early 2016, thousands of dry lightning strikes exacerbated by rising global temperatures sparked wildfires across Tasmania, including in ancient alpine ecosystems unique to the stateâ\\x80\\x99s world heritage wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe really need legislation that prioritises our life support system â\\x80¦ We canâ\\x80\\x99t just deal with one hectare at a time Prof Lesley Hughes\\r\\n\\r\\nGondwanan species that had lived more than a thousand years and had not historically burned, such as pencil pines, were killed on the stateâ\\x80\\x99s central plateau. It led to warnings that governments should be doing more to protect internationally recognised landscapes as part of their fire response.\\r\\n\\r\\nShaw says the reaction in the wake of the fires has been heartening: the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Parks and Wildlife Service has installed sprinkler and fire retardant systems close to the central plateau so it will be able to respond more quickly and effectively next time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Tasmanian story is a sign of what you can do,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cThe challenge is that in places like the Great Barrier Reef, the Murray-Darling basin and mountain ash forests the scale is huge but I would say it shows, at some scale, we can know what is necessary and what can be done at a local level.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPut another way, what is happening is depressing because the problems are complex, but not because we donâ\\x80\\x99t have the answers.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is whether those answers are sought, let alone listened to. The Morrison governmentâ\\x80\\x99s initial response to the Samuel reviewâ\\x80\\x99s damning assessment of the state of the environment has been to introduce legislation that would hand development approval powers to the states and territories â\\x80\\x93 a step that did nothing to improve ecosystem or species protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHughes says here lies the glaring problem. â\\x80\\x9cThe issue is we donâ\\x80\\x99t currently have a government that is tackling this,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cWe really need legislation that prioritises our life support system and is capable of dealing with complex and interacting risks.

Also called ahi tuna, this species is massively overfished in the Indian Ocean â\\x80\\x93 so much so that supermarkets and brands including Tesco, Co-op and Princes recently took the surprising step of joining scientists and environmental groups to call for tough action to rebuild the $4bn population.\\r\\n\\r\\nNGOs demand action not promises as EU accused of â\\x80\\x98failing to protect seasâ\\x80\\x99 Read more\\r\\n\\r\\nBut although the Indian Ocean is bordered by Africa, Asia and Australia, the single biggest harvester of yellowfin in the area is the European Union. EU nations â\\x80\\x93 principally Spain and France â\\x80\\x93 operate a â\\x80\\x9cdistant water fleetâ\\x80\\x9d of 43 vessels that fish the seas thousands of miles from home. In 2019 they caught 70,000 tonnes of yellowfin, more than Indian Ocean coastal states such as Iran (58,000 tonnes), Sri Lanka and the Maldives (44,000 tonnes each).\\r\\n\\r\\nEU ships are major users of â\\x80\\x9cfish-aggregating devicesâ\\x80\\x9d (FADs). These fishing aids are floating objects that cast a shadow to attract groupings of fish. By casting nets near FADs, catches can be increased with less effort but can lead to more bycatch â\\x80\\x93 including juvenile tuna that have not yet reproduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow a row has broken out between the EU and the tiny developing coastal states whose economies are directly dependent on the Indian Ocean. A former Seychelles fishery official has accused the EU of â\\x80\\x9chypocrisy and neocolonialismâ\\x80\\x9d, while the Maldives described the EUâ\\x80\\x99s proposals to rebuild yellowfin populations as â\\x80\\x9cwoefully inadequateâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tuna being unloaded at MalÃ©.

Both the EU and the Maldives, out of 33 parties involved, have made proposals to the IOTC to reduce overfishing and rebuild populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the much poorer Maldives, however, that has proposed the toughest reductions. The EU is calling for a much less dramatic cut. Neither include measures to reduce the use of FADs, which NGOs say drives population decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is a â\\x80\\x98band-aidâ\\x80\\x99 measure from the EU,â\\x80\\x9d said Adam Ziyad, director general of the Maldives fisheries ministry and vice-chair of the IOTC. â\\x80\\x9cIt is nowhere near the required reduction levels to ensure we conserve the yellowfin stocks for our future generations. If they were serious, they would take a bigger hit and they would work with coastal states to have a better management plan.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 20% of the Maldives workforce is involved in fishing, mainly using pole and line rather than big nets.

It claimed that the Maldives proposal was not â\\x80\\x9cproportionate or equitableâ\\x80\\x9d either, because it focused on purse seiners, a type of wide-net fishing that is not generally practised by Maldives pole-and-line fishers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yellowfin tuna are weighed at MalÃ© fish market.

Winds of up to 280km/h claimed 44 lives, leaving more than 40,000 homes damaged or destroyed, and storm surges smashed reefs in their path. Winston caused US$1.4bn in damage, the most destructive cyclone ever in the Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut four years on, to the delight of scientists, the coral reefs of the Fijian archipelago are vibrantly resurgent and once again teeming with fish and colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nYashika Nand, science coordinator at the Wildlife Conservation Society Fiji, inspects corals during a survey dive in Vatu-i-Ra.

Naturally, everyone felt that Covid restrictions were tough luck for the festivalâ\\x80\\x99s directors, Carlo Chatrian and Mariette Rissenbeek, now in their second year; after 2020â\\x80\\x99s respectable but low-key debut, it seemed that they had been robbed of the chance to consolidate in style.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, against all odds, they did precisely that. There were no red carpets, no press conferences, no glitz; all that, itâ\\x80\\x99s hoped, will come in June, when the same programme returns with a planned live summer special. Meanwhile, virtual Berlin pinned me to my sofa with the most impressive selection in years. The competition (15 titles, only slightly smaller than usual) wasnâ\\x80\\x99t packed with luminaries either. Instead, a mix of reputed directors, plus some new names, offered films of consistent, seriously watchable, sometimes dazzling quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best competition titles, Maria Spethâ\\x80\\x99s Mr Bachmann and His Class, is a no-frills documentary about Dieter Bachmann, a teacher in an industrial town in Germany, and his class of teenage pupils from Turkish and other immigrant backgrounds. At three and a half hours, it gives us time to know the students and their singularly laid-back teacher â\\x80\\x93 imagine a German Bill Murray in an AC/DC T-shirt â\\x80\\x93 who engages and empowers them with patience and empathy. One of the competitionâ\\x80\\x99s absolute finest, it won the Silver Bear jury prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Bachmann and His Class. Photograph: Madonnen Film\\r\\n\\r\\nNo awards, alas, for another film that was one of my favourites and won a lot of fans â\\x80\\x93 the fabulously imaginative, gently upbeat Georgian film What Do We See When We Look at the Sky?. Alexandre Koberidzeâ\\x80\\x99s eccentric meta-fairytale is about a couple whose budding romance is scuppered by a curse that changes their appearance â\\x80\\x93 set against a background in which a city prepares for the World Cup. Any touches of whimsy (insights into the thoughts of local football-loving dogs) are counteracted by elegant directorial and narrative invention. This is European art cinema at its most irresistibly playful.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome films were true to the traditionally sombre image of Berlin competition programming, but powerfully so. There was the mandatory austere Iranian drama: Ballad of a White Cow, directed by Behtash Sanaeeha and Maryam Moghaddam, about a woman dealing with the aftermath of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s execution. But this dark social fable is handled with rigorous control, and features a compelling lead performance from co-director Moghaddam. And Natural Light is a phenomenally confident debut from DÃ©nes Nagy, about troops from German-aligned Hungary rooting out partisans in the second world war. Apart from confronting what it means to be on the wrong side of history, itâ\\x80\\x99s a meticulously textured depiction of mud, tree bark, lined faces â\\x80\\x93 and of horror. Superbly shot in a dark palette, it is one of the films I most yearned to see on the big screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nDan Stevens and Maren Eggert in Iâ\\x80\\x99m Your Man.

This thinking robotâ\\x80\\x99s romcom is a flip but philosophical story about a woman who finds herself road-testing a male android designed as the perfect partner. It threatens to be arch, but proves very enjoyable, thanks to a sharp script and pitch-perfect leads from Maren Eggert and Downton Abbeyâ\\x80\\x99s Dan Stevens, wryly self-mocking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film that eventually won the Golden Bear was Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, by Romanian director Radu Jude. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a sort of conceptual comedy about Emi, a schoolteacher (Katia Pascariu, very good) who faces an investigation when her sex tape ends up circulating online, but Jude doesnâ\\x80\\x99t stage it as straight narrative. Instead, itâ\\x80\\x99s a triptych â\\x80\\x93 one part following Emi around the streets of Bucharest (where, the director seems to be telling us, consumerism is the real pornography), one a montage-style â\\x80\\x9cdictionaryâ\\x80\\x9d of ironic definitions of words and phrases, the third a theatrical tableau in which Emi faces her accusers. Jude is one of the most adventurous and unpredictable of directors, but this work, while brashly experimental and quite outrageously in-your-face, is hit-and-miss, a somewhat jarring mix of the Godardian oblique and the downright bleeding obvious.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatia Pascariu in Golden Bear winner Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, directed by Radu Jude. Photograph: Â© Silviu Ghetie / Micro Film 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most awaited competition title was from Franceâ\\x80\\x99s CÃ©line Sciamma. In contrast with her recent films Girlhood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Petite Maman is very low-key indeed â\\x80\\x93 a 72-minute miniature about an eight-year-old girl whose new friend exists in a strange parallel world. It could have been merely winsome, but Sciammaâ\\x80\\x99s control and superb direction of her young leads, real-life twins JosÃ©phine and Gabrielle Sanz, makes it something quietly special and deeply resonant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn much brasher mode is A Cop Movie, by Mexican director Alonso Ruizpalacios, a documentary about two officers in Mexico Cityâ\\x80\\x99s police force â\\x80\\x93 well, sort of. Jazzed up in a style thatâ\\x80\\x99s as much music video as procedural thriller, it shows officers Teresa and Montoya â\\x80\\x93 professional and personal partners â\\x80\\x93 talking about their work and their private lives in a series of reconstructed episodes. Then Ruizpalacios pulls away the carpet to show two actors preparing the roles weâ\\x80\\x99ve just seen them play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film brilliantly measures the reality of street law against the movie myth, and offers an incisive take on one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s more controversial policing systems.

       " 'The dramatic fuse of Netflixâ\\x80\\x99s Moxie, out this week, will be familiar to anyone with knowledge of Mean Girls, the seminal 2004 teen comedy co-starring Moxieâ\\x80\\x99s director, Amy Poehler. Like Regina George (Rachel McAdams) before her, Poehlerâ\\x80\\x99s on-screen daughter Vivian (Hadley Robinson) surreptitiously distributes black-and-white xeroxes of anonymously produced, explosive content in the bathroom before school starts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whereas Regina unleashed her Burn Book â\\x80\\x93 a collage of insults, inside jokes and petty humiliations â\\x80\\x93 on to Mean Girlsâ\\x80\\x99 suburban high school to detonate social anarchy (and thus, regain Queen Bee control), Vivianâ\\x80\\x99s info drop is far less diabolical, even wholesome. Inspired by her motherâ\\x80\\x99s riot grrrl past, sheâ\\x80\\x99s written an anonymous feminist zine, Moxie, with the aim of, if not overthrowing the patriarchy, at least inspiring the female students to reject the mundane (though certainly not benign) sexism of American high school: ranking teen girlsâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cbangable-nessâ\\x80\\x9d, double-standard dress codes, underappreciation of objectively higher-achieving female athletes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMean Girls, written by Tina Fey, remains a highly rewatchable and quotable teen classic, but itâ\\x80\\x99s hard not to read Moxieâ\\x80\\x99s female solidarity against status quo sexism as a rejoinder to the first filmâ\\x80\\x99s focus on girl-on-girl crime. Poehlerâ\\x80\\x99s film, based on Jennifer Mathieuâ\\x80\\x99s YA book of the same name, is the latest example in a seemingly crestless, streaming-led wave of content about and for teens that riff on the genreâ\\x80\\x99s well-worn staples (the climactic party scene, the scrambling of clique lines, the de-masking of anonymity, missing parents) while revising its more problematic tropes. Unshackled from box office expectations and conventional wisdom, streaming services, with their near-bottomless wells of cash, have made a virtual cottage industry of the once-flatlined teen movie. These films and shows, many written and directed by women and people of color and often arising from young adult fictionâ\\x80\\x99s movement to center marginalized perspectives, are queerer, raunchier, more frank regarding race, identity and sex; like Moxie, theyâ\\x80\\x99re less patient and self-referential with sexism, aimed for the more progressive politics of Gen Z, and designed for their personal screens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past five years, teen content has centered protagonists who are neither white (Netflixâ\\x80\\x99s Mindy Kaling series Never Have I Ever, its To All the Boys Iâ\\x80\\x99ve Loved Before franchise; Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s Selah and the Spades) nor straight (Love, Simon and its spin-off series Love, Victor; Netflixâ\\x80\\x99s The Half of It). Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve taken sexual and gender fluidity as a given (HBO Maxâ\\x80\\x99s upcoming Generation) and made a trans teenage character half of a central romantic storyline (Emmy-winning hit Euphoria). Some, such as Sex Education and Big Mouth, used foul-mouthed raunch to wheedle into the vulnerable heart, and palpable fear, of adolescent sexuality; others tackled thornier topics â\\x80\\x93 abortion (HBO Maxâ\\x80\\x99s Unpregnant), suicide (Netflixâ\\x80\\x99s 13 Reasons Why), drug addiction (HBOâ\\x80\\x99s Euphoria again â\\x80\\x93 if itâ\\x80\\x99s serious or shocking, itâ\\x80\\x99s on Euphoria), and anti-black police brutality (The Hate U Give). Films starring white female protagonists, such as Moxie and Booksmart, have offered a more nuanced understanding of what teen girls actually care about: sex, sometimes; best friendshipsâ\\x80\\x99 electric, irreplaceable intimacy; for a sizable but limited slice of American high schoolers, getting into a competitive college.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe â\\x80\\x9cteenâ\\x80\\x9d genre is admittedly loose, rangy and unclassified â\\x80\\x93 it can span horror (Scream) to sports (Friday Night Lights), Shakespeare (10 Things I Hate About You, O, Sheâ\\x80\\x99s the Man) to dystopian action (Red Dawn); they can even be aimed for adults, as long as theyâ\\x80\\x99re rooted in the adolescent perspective â\\x80\\x93 confused and insecure, yearning, unsure of who oneâ\\x80\\x99s about to become.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeath Ledger and Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You.

Though movies about teens or marketed to them date to the 1950s, when â\\x80\\x9cteen cultureâ\\x80\\x9d became a national fixation with films such as Rebel Without a Cause, the â\\x80\\x9cteen filmâ\\x80\\x9d as we know it originates in the 1980s, the era of John Hughes films such as The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink as well as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the violent dark comedy Heathers. These films were popular, enjoyable, and remain, for many, beloved; they also focused overwhelmingly on straight, white characters, and are laced with casual homophobia or sexism. With the exception of Ridgemont, which was written by Cameron Crowe and directed by Amy Heckerling, they were directed by white men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the 80s had the Brat Pack movies, the 90s saw its own teen movie boom, particularly in the second half of the decade, after Clueless, Scream and the sleeper hit The Craft demonstrated to studios the audience demand for films about teenagers, of any tone. By 1999, a watershed year for now classic teen movies, the genre was a full, overperforming commercial force. The breezy Shakespeare-but-today 10 Things I Hate About You, written by two women, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, grossed $53.5m on a $16m budget; Varsity Blues, American Pie and Sheâ\\x80\\x99s All That were made for a collective $37m and raked in $393m. The cheerleading tentpole Bring It On, which pitted Kirsten Dunst against cheer rival Gabrielle Union, grossed $90m on a $10m budget the following year. Mean Girls, made for $17m, grossed $130m at the box office.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conventions of studio teen fare were grooved enough to merit films which parodied (2001â\\x80\\x99s Not Another Teen Movie) or flouted (Rian Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s Brick) the genreâ\\x80\\x99s broadly understood tropes â\\x80\\x93 stock characters such as cheerleaders and jocks, bold-font messaging, scenes at prom. Also: conveying the imagined concerns of teenagers through straight, white, cisgender, able-bodied and thin characters, predominantly written and directed by white men. This uniformity held throughout the mid-to-late 2000s, whether the films zinged (the stoner classic Superbad in 2007) or floundered in sexist jokes about, say, female hormones (John Tucker Must Die in 2006). On the mainstream 2000s teen TV soaps â\\x80\\x93 One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, 90210 and, a micro-generation before that, The OC, Dawsonâ\\x80\\x99s Creek and Buffy the Vampire Slayer â\\x80\\x93 American teens got, consistently, in varying tones, one sliver of representation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, production of teen films, as well as other related mid-budget movie genres like the romcom, basically cratered as Hollywood diverged into big-budget superhero flicks and small, quiet indies. There were outliers â\\x80\\x93 the breezy Easy A in 2010, in which Emma Stone turned fixation on a teen girlâ\\x80\\x99s perceived sexual availability into a riff on The Scarlet Letter, grossed $75m on an $8m budget. But given the $312m grossed domestically by Iron Man 2 that year, or the $415m by Toy Story 3, Hollywood interest lay elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nMegan Lawless, Amandla Stenberg and Sabrina Carpenter in The Hate U Give. Photograph: Allstar/Fox 2000 Pictures\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, desire by actual teens for content reflecting their lived experience never wavered; destabilization by high-voltage emotions in a changing body remains one of humanityâ\\x80\\x99s few truly universal experiences. By the early 2010s, several rapid changes to the content landscape â\\x80\\x93 boundless streaming services, vocal online audiences and a movement within YA fiction toward more progressive, diverse characters and storylines â\\x80\\x93 aligned for a full revival, and overdue revision, of the genre. Untethered from box office pressure, Netflix (and soon Amazon, HBO Max and Hulu), could afford to throw ideas at neglected genres such as the romcom or teen movie, and reasonably expect sizable audiences to tune in from their couches. Concurrently, original work representing racially diverse, queerer perspectives emerged out of the YA fiction world, which preceded television and film in taking marginalized or misrepresented characters in teen fare seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe YA-to-teen movie pipeline gushed through the latest teen revival year, 2018, with the release of The Hate U Give, the adaptation of Angie Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s book on a black teenage girlâ\\x80\\x99s code-switching and political awakening to the Black Lives Matter movement after police kill her childhood friend, and Love, Simon, based on the YA book by Becky Albertalli about a gay teen who navigates coming out to friends and family through anonymous emails with a mystery classmate. This was also the year To All the Boys Iâ\\x80\\x99ve Loved Before, based on the YA series by Jenny Han, a Korean-American author born in 1980, codified homegrown Netflix romcom success. Netflix is coy on viewership figures but To All the Boys, as well as the less critically beloved The Kissing Booth, but both were widely viewed and rewatched, triggering sequels, the Netflix sub-genre of Noah Centineo films (Sierra Burgess Is a Loser, The Perfect Date), and success metrics of social media followings for Netflixâ\\x80\\x99s homegrown talent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNick Robinson in Love, Simon. Photograph: Allstar/FOX 2000 PICTURES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2020s now offer a virtual buffet for teen content playing to the progressive interests, if not always taste, of Gen Z, from original content to the streaming warsâ\\x80\\x99 insatiable appetite for reboots. Mean Girls was adapted (and updated) into a Broadway musical, which itself will be adapted into a feature film for Paramount. Heâ\\x80\\x99s All That, a gender-flipped Sheâ\\x80\\x99s All That, will star the TikTok phenom Addison Rae. And HBO Maxâ\\x80\\x99s upcoming Gossip Girl reboot will reportedly revise the original showâ\\x80\\x99s limitations, with a diverse cast and, according to executive producer Joshua Safran, â\\x80\\x9ca lot of queer contentâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oft-repeated line in representation is more is better, but not all progressive-seeming updates land. The disastrous (and now cancelled) Heathers reboot on Paramount, which reimagined the schoolâ\\x80\\x99s conventionally beautiful mean-girl bullies as a genderqueer student, a biracial girl and a fat girl, seemed to both misunderstand the original movie and disastrously misread current audiencesâ\\x80\\x99 appetite for content involving school violence, especially in the wake of mass shootings. Grand Army, Netflixâ\\x80\\x99s Brooklyn high school answer to Euphoria, was derailed after a former writer accused the showrunner and creator of â\\x80\\x9cracist exploitation and abuseâ\\x80\\x9d, leading to her departure. 13 Reasons Why drew intense criticism for what many experts called a romanticization of teen suicide; one study found that suicide among teenagers rose by 28.9% in the month after its Netflix launch.\\r\\n\\r\\nUly Schlesinger, Justice Smith and Chase Sui Wonders in Generation. Photograph: HBO Max\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter on-paper representation doesnâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily mean better shows â\\x80\\x93 HBO Maxâ\\x80\\x99s Generation, to be released this month, written in part by 19-year-old Zelda Barnz, takes sexual and gender fluidity as a given and peppers its dialogue with â\\x80\\x9cwokeâ\\x80\\x9d catchphrases, but the tic plays like a callous shield for poor writing and paper-thin characters. Creating progressive, diverse high schoolers can appeal to under-represented audiences, but itâ\\x80\\x99s not an out for treating them with total disingenuousness. Its thinness is particularly glaring when compared with Euphoria, HBOâ\\x80\\x99s first teen show that, for all its stylistic flourishes and aggressive imagery (full-frontal nudity, a graphic overdose scene), handles a host of thorny, often bungled topics with care. Like an old teen soap, Euphoria, created by Sam Levinson and directed by several women, including Augustine Frizzell, Jennifer Morrison and Pippa Bianco, depicts extreme teen behavior, but with a realistic grasp on the toxic toll of stifled male anger, the destruction addiction wreaks on relationships, and the tricky power negotiations of hookup apps and sexting. The showâ\\x80\\x99s central romance between Rue (Zendaya, the youngest ever Emmy winner for best drama actress) and Jules (Hunter Schafer), a trans newcomer to the school, is treated as organic and alchemic rather than a political statement, and has become the subject of intense online fandom â\\x80\\x93 popularity which evinces both audience hunger for more inclusive, sensitive representation and old-guard networksâ\\x80\\x99 efforts to win younger audiences away from streamers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat wide, uneven net of the teen content wars â\\x80\\x93 pick a genre, thereâ\\x80\\x99s probably a teen show or film â\\x80\\x93 feels like a nutritive balm, no matter how much one reveres the classics. Watching Vivianâ\\x80\\x99s nascent political awareness in Moxie, I was reminded how much I adored (and endlessly rewatched) the original Mean Girls, and yet how deeply I still craved something that felt even remotely close to my far less catty experience at a suburban high school, and more responsive to the sexist standards I internalized more than called out. How much a film about a girl whoâ\\x80\\x99s growing into activism and herself, uncomfortably but not extremely, would have meant to an insecure high school student like me even eight years ago; how much young adults crave feeling understood, seen. Given the evergreen bottomlessness of adolescent feelings, itâ\\x80\\x99s unlikely weâ\\x80\\x99ll reach peak teen; with streamingâ\\x80\\x99s rising tide, itâ\\x80\\x99s a genre in upswell, revising, for better and sometimes for worse, itself.',\n",
       " 'Itâ\\x80\\x99s midnight on 9 November 1989 and the mood in the American embassy in East Berlin is smug. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the end of the cold war,â\\x80\\x9d West German agent Brigitte Winkelmann tells CIA counterpart Hector Valdez. A few streets away, the Berlin Wall has been breached by East Germans bent on trading up from Trabants to the KaDeWe department store. Border guards are experiencing something new â\\x80\\x93 being hugged by their compatriots. All that remains, youâ\\x80\\x99d think, is for Francis Fukuyama to proclaim that history is over and the west has won.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHopefully not,â\\x80\\x9d retorts Hector drily. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99d have to find a new enemy and who would that be?â\\x80\\x9d In a matter of years, according to Samuel Huntingtonâ\\x80\\x99s Clash of Civilisations, the west would find an Islamist surrogate for red peril, but for that moment, history was poised. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know, I mean everybody loves America,â\\x80\\x9d Brigitte counters, proving, not for the first time in this show, that Germans can do sarcasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love that the creators of Deutschland 89 (More 4) Anna and JÃ¶rg Winger (the former also co-creator of Unorthodox), deconstruct western hubris in the third series of this Walter Presents drama about the decline and fall of the Stasi. For decades, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen montages of East Germans scrambling over the wall, ostensibly to freedom, leaving socialism deader than disco. In this episode, the melancholic Kyrie Eleison from Bachâ\\x80\\x99s B minor Mass undercuts those montagesâ\\x80\\x99 western triumphalism. KÃ½rie, elÃ©ison means â\\x80\\x9cLord, have mercyâ\\x80\\x9d. It is as if the Wingers are suggesting that itâ\\x80\\x99s not just the Stasi, the KGB and other soon-to-be obsolete cold warriors who will be needing mercy in the new world order, but all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, not every German was in party mood. In a West German prison, our heroine, Stasi agent Lenora Rauch (the captivating Maria Schrader) lights another cigarette as the news came through about the fall of the wall. â\\x80\\x9cPeople are screaming for freedom and capitalism is what theyâ\\x80\\x99ll get,â\\x80\\x9d she snarls superbly to anyone listening. â\\x80\\x9dCapitalism is nothing but capitalism. It serves no other purpose. Not freedom, nothing. Capitalism sucks everyone in, and devours them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis speech could equally have been written for Keri Russell or Matthew Rhys, who played KGB spies in The Americans, had that drama traced communism to its bitter end. Deutschland 89 goes where The Americans feared to tread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charmingly daft suggestion of this opening episode was that the Berlin Wall fell because Rauchâ\\x80\\x99s nephew, Zelig-like super-spy Martin (Jonas Ney, still resembling a Joy Division tribute actâ\\x80\\x99s drummer) went rogue. Tasked with delivering a secret document recommending the relaxing of travel restrictions for East Germans, Martin convinces the GDRâ\\x80\\x99s central committee that the document has Moscowâ\\x80\\x99s all-important approval. As a result, it soon becomes law and an announcement is made on state TV, prompting mass exodus and, in Stasi HQ, panic. â\\x80\\x9cPlease bring all available shredders to Fuchsâ\\x80\\x99 office,â\\x80\\x9d officer Schweppenstette barks into his phone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn previous series, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen evil Stasi agents earn hard currency by selling blood without testing whether it was infected with HIV, as well as smuggling arms to South Africaâ\\x80\\x99s apartheid government and to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war. We should be glad theyâ\\x80\\x99re getting their comeuppance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of this episode, though, a Stasi agent belatedly grows a conscience. Fritz Hartmann, having infiltrated an illegal Trotskyist group, reports back to his bosses that these renegades might just have an idea that could save the GDR. The government should transfer all its capital to bankroll co-operatives, giving farmers and workers an equal share of national wealth. For the first time, the GDR would fulfil its constitutionâ\\x80\\x99s egalitarian promises. â\\x80\\x9cJa? Und?â\\x80\\x9d sneers his boss, Markus Fuchs. Fuchs knows the hideous truth. It is too late for the GDR to save itself, still less for it to belatedly choose the correct path to socialism.',\n",
       " 'In spring 2020, as Covid-19 spread fear and infection around the globe, seismologists were able to track â\\x80\\x9ca wave of silence passing over the earth, its course exactly following that of the virusâ\\x80\\x9d. According to Steven Lovatt, silence descended on Britain, perhaps for the first time since the Industrial Revolution: â\\x80\\x9cFinally, the earth could hear itself think, and the voice of its thought was song.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic struck in the northern hemisphere just at the moment when birdsong was resuming after the bleak winter months. That â\\x80\\x9cstrangest springâ\\x80\\x9d will be remembered not just for the new virus, but as the time when the nation became aware of birdsong. Silent streets and gardens were filled with â\\x80\\x9ca rising choir of chirps, trills and warblesâ\\x80\\x9d. People shared recordings made on their phones of â\\x80\\x9cthe woozy fluting of blackbirdsâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cthe deep purring of wood pigeonsâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nLockdown also reawakened Lovattâ\\x80\\x99s passion for birds. As a child he had been awestruck by the starlings that roosted in Birmingham during the winter: â\\x80\\x9cThey swirled and pulsed in the sky-space between concrete towers as though a dark dough of poppyseeds was being stretched and kneaded by invisible hands.â\\x80\\x9d By his teens he could identify most British birds. But then his interest faded â\\x80\\x93 until last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie Marlandâ\\x80\\x99s illustration of the Skylark, from Birdsong in a Time of Silence. Photograph: Katie Marland\\r\\n\\r\\nBeautifully illustrated in black and white by Katie Marland, Birdsong in a Time of Silence begins early in the morning of 24 March, the day after normal life in Britain was suspended. Lovattâ\\x80\\x99s slim yet wonderfully evocative book records his walks and observations of nature and birds during the spring and summer, drawing on poetry, folk songs, myths and science to reveal the key role birdsong has played not just in our culture, but our life-worlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nLovatt points out that birdsong probably hasnâ\\x80\\x99t changed much since the stone age. It has been the soundtrack to the evolution of our species: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s part of our feeling of belonging in the world â\\x80¦ we have birdsong in the blood.â\\x80\\x9d It is a reminder of the natural world and â\\x80\\x9cthe circular, seasonal time that never ceases to follow its own patternsâ\\x80\\x9d. Today, being able to recognise birdsong, such as the insistent alarm calls of the blackbird when it spots a cat, enriches oneâ\\x80\\x99s understanding of the world â\\x80\\x9cby revealing an almost forgotten aspect of the grammar of realityâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nBirdsong also shapes our identity as individuals. The songs and calls of birds that Lovatt encountered on his lockdown walks bring back childhood memories, such as waking in his grandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s house in the 1980s and hearing the calls of house martins nesting in the eaves â\\x80\\x9cwhich reminded me of the working of knitting needlesâ\\x80\\x9d. In its ability to spark forgotten memories and connect us to nature, birdsong is, says Lovatt, both â\\x80\\x9cplainly mystical and profoundly ordinaryâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse Sparrow. Illustration: Katie Marland\\r\\n\\r\\nLovatt deftly captures the character and personality of the birds he describes: from the ubiquitous blackbird, whose song can be heard across the land and forms â\\x80\\x9can essential ingredientâ\\x80\\x9d of what we know as home, to the â\\x80\\x9cstrange and magicalâ\\x80\\x9d sound of skylarks, the â\\x80\\x9cguttural croaksâ\\x80\\x9d of herons, and the â\\x80\\x9cchatters, pop-gun detonations and saucy whistlesâ\\x80\\x9d of starlings, who he says â\\x80\\x9chave arguably the greatest repertoire of any British birdâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 220 bird species that breed in the British Isles and as many as a quarter migrate here. Swallows fly from South Africa, some 6,000 miles away, to grace our skies. Quite how they navigate remains a mystery. In the era of climate crisis, fewer are migrating. The corncrakes and quail that Lovattâ\\x80\\x99s grandparents would have heard are less common today, as are the nightingales and turtle doves that his parents would have listened to: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve never heard any of these species in Britain.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHabitat depletion and the catastrophic decline in insect numbers means there are millions fewer birds in the country than when Lovatt was a child. As well as a big ecological problem, this impoverished soundscape is â\\x80\\x9ca great loss for our sense of who we are as human beingsâ\\x80\\x9d. Our idea of summer was once defined by the sound of birds such as cuckoos and turtle doves, â\\x80\\x9cthe aural equivalent of a heat haze, the gentlest corrugation of air, always just on the edge of your hearingâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a joyous and profound meditation on birdsong and what it means to us, a book that brings to life an essential part of the natural world that most of us take so much for granted that we scarcely notice it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBirdsong in a Time of Silence is published by Particular (Â£12.99).

       " 'Five years ago, Nathalie Warmerdam was murdered by her ex-partner in one of the worst cases of domestic violence in Canadian history. The 48-year-old was Basil Borutskiâ\\x80\\x99s third victim that day; he also killed two other former partners, Anastasia Kuzyk and Carol Culleton. Boruktski was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarmerdamâ\\x80\\x99s brother Joshua Hopkins, an acclaimed baritone, was rehearsing in Ottawa when he received the call.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was horrifying. I was sent reeling, it was an emotionally very turbulent time and I felt helpless, powerless to do anything to help my sister,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cBut I knew that as an opera singer I had a voice and I could use that voice to tell my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s story and also to bring awareness to the global epidemic that is violence against women and gender-based violence. The idea behind it was to honour my sister.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Hopkins releases Songs for Murdered Sisters, a new eight-song cycle written by Margaret Atwood and composer Jake Heggie, which opens with Atwoodâ\\x80\\x99s lyric: â\\x80\\x9cWho was my sister / is now an empty chair / Is no longer / Is no longer there / She is now emptiness / She is now air.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret Atwood has known two women who were murdered, â\\x80\\x98both by jealous former romantic partners, so the killing of Joshuaâ\\x80\\x99s sister resonated with meâ\\x80\\x99.

But she ended up writing the sequence in one session. â\\x80\\x9cI made the â\\x80\\x98sistersâ\\x80\\x99 plural because they are indeed â\\x80\\x93 unhappily â\\x80\\x93 very plural.

So many,â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtwood has known two women who were murdered, â\\x80\\x9cboth by jealous former romantic partners, so the killing of Joshuaâ\\x80\\x99s sister resonated with meâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is a person who went around and killed three people on the same day. And for each of those three people, you have a whole extended group of individuals who are affected, so anybody related to them, all of their friends â\\x80\\x93 it just carves a big hole in the lives of other people,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s pretty devastating. Joshua, of course, was very upset and talked about some of his emotion. So I tried to put some of that in as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHopkins wept when he first read Atwoodâ\\x80\\x99s poems, which are included in her latest collection, Dearly. â\\x80\\x9cI was completely in tears, they spoke to me so deeply,â\\x80\\x9d he says, reading out an email he sent her at the time. â\\x80\\x9cI never could have imagined that my grief, my guilt, my anger, could have been so elegantly crafted into such beautiful and striking words.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe really admired that Margaret made it universal,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Sistersâ\\x80\\x99 does not just mean blood sisters, or adopted sisters, but all the women that are close to us.

While the pandemic has postponed live performances, a digital album, sung by Hopkins, launches on Friday, with an accompanying film directed by James Niebuhr. During the recording sessions, Heggie and Hopkins kept a photograph of Nathalie watching over them on a screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeggie envisaged the song cycle in the vein of Schubertâ\\x80\\x99s Die Winterreise (Winterâ\\x80\\x99s Journey) song cycle: â\\x80\\x9cA wanderer trying to make sense of the world â\\x80\\x93 grief-stricken and seeking transformation, connection, meaning, perhaps redemption â\\x80¦ somewhere, somehow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c[Atwood] chose words that are singable, left places for musical interludes and where we could hear and see the singer transformed,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cIn the penultimate song, she left a question hanging in the air: â\\x80\\x98Would you instead forgive?â\\x80\\x99 That question of forgiveness opens a new possibility â\\x80\\x93 a new light that breaks through.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHopkins is now hoping to motivate 10,000 men to take the White Ribbon Pledge, promising â\\x80\\x9cnever to commit, condone, or remain silent about all forms of gender-based violenceâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI felt so numb after Nathalieâ\\x80\\x99s murder,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cIt was so shocking, it was almost impossible to comprehend. But Margaretâ\\x80\\x99s words and Jakeâ\\x80\\x99s music have opened a door, and stepping through it has allowed me to access all my complicated feelings surrounding Nathalieâ\\x80\\x99s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t process grief in a linear fashion â\\x80\\x93 any emotion can come up any time. But meaning transforms grief into a more peaceful and hopeful experience. These songs have provided that meaning for me.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

After university, she came to realise that it was a career she would find immensely rewarding â\\x80\\x93 and one that would allow her to continue her outdoorsy lifestyle.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEven back in sixth form, I would learn by helping my friends and teaching them. I also tutored pupils taking economics A-level while I was studying it at university. When I was in Australia, as well as leading horseback tours I taught at a riding school and worked as a surf instructor.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking by the coast gives Grimes her ideal work-life balance\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Grimes, teaching on the north-east coast has provided the perfect work-life balance, allowing her to not only pursue, but actually combine, her passions for teaching and surfing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think the skills of teaching surfing and teaching in school are totally transferable,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cIn both cases Iâ\\x80\\x99m sharing my skills and passions. Obviously teaching maths is a lot more formal, but whether Iâ\\x80\\x99m on the beach or in the classroom itâ\\x80\\x99s about building collaborative relationships.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately for Grimes, sheâ\\x80\\x99s found a school with an outlook that matches her surferâ\\x80\\x99s spirit. â\\x80\\x9cWhat I like about Monkseaton high is that its ethos is based on equality, positivity and mutual respect. You can feel that in a school. Itâ\\x80\\x99s welcoming.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I like it when pupils find out that I surf,â\\x80\\x99 says Grimes\\r\\n\\r\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s not to say that her students arenâ\\x80\\x99t sometimes a little taken aback when they discover that their new maths teacher likes to ride waves in her spare time. On discovering Grimesâ\\x80\\x99s hobby, a rather perplexed year 10 student remarked: â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t even realise teachers had lives!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n'They gave me a key to another world': the polyglot teacher bringing languages to life Read more\\r\\n\\r\\nGrimes smiles: â\\x80\\x9cI like it when pupils find out that I surf. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll see the surfboards on top of my car, and see me heading off after school when the surf is good, and ask about it, which I love. I want to make sure they see me as approachable and know there is mutual respect.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, itâ\\x80\\x99s exactly these kind of exchanges that have led Grimes to love her career in teaching. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the relationships that you build with the pupils, and the interaction,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cI get so much out of it when I see pupils progress. People may think that teaching or helping people is a selfless act, but it actually makes me feel so good. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a really unbeatable feeling.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn teaching every day is different, and so is every teacher. Discover 100 teachers across the country, shaping lives.

       " 'Rihula Sameer-Mour at her school in Didsbury, Manchester\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a young age my parents taught my siblings and me that education was freedom. I was born on Fuvahmulah, an island in the Maldives with few schools and around 40 in a class. Good grades were highly valued and my parents encouraged hard work. Education brought opportunities we werenâ\\x80\\x99t born with; it was the way to build a good life. My mother, Khaulath, was head of English at the school, and my father, Abdulla, whoâ\\x80\\x99s a well-known poet, taught Dhivehi, our local dialect, so teaching was in my DNA.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s a gift to be the gay role model I needed in my teensâ\\x80\\x99: the teacher who came out in assembly Read more\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was eight years old we moved to Australia where mum studied for her degree in education. I went to a school that was creative and enriching, with lots of outdoor learning. I was the only child who wasnâ\\x80\\x99t white but, as a kid, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t notice our differences. We moved to England when I was 13, this time for mumâ\\x80\\x99s PhD. School, in inner-city Manchester, was a different environment again. My friends and I were studious and had to work hard to make it, but I got A*-B grades at GCSE and went on to A-levels and an English degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think teaching is in my DNA. As a child, I would make registers and pretend to teach at home. I knew it was a good job and saw the respect that my parents earned from people on the island who, long after theyâ\\x80\\x99d left school, would come up to them to say how theyâ\\x80\\x99d inspired them. I saw my parentsâ\\x80\\x99 dedication and how happy the job made them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sameer-Mour with her family at her motherâ\\x80\\x99s graduation\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother died in 2013, weeks after giving birth to my youngest sister. The day before she slipped into a coma, I was due in London for my teacher training interview. I wanted to stay at her bedside but mum told me to go. I missed her final, waking day. From then on, everything in my career has had to be worth it, it has to mean something. I help care for my younger siblings (I am one of five) and I guide them with their school work. My parentsâ\\x80\\x99 inspiration is everything to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I took my first teaching job in 2014 I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t sure I was cut out for it, but the school I teach in now has changed my life. I joined four years ago and was given a mentor. He taught me how to be a creative and inspiring teacher, and gave me confidence. I made friends and now mentor trainee teachers myself. Teaching is not just about the children, itâ\\x80\\x99s the mark you can make on colleagues and the community too.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With her grandmother in the Maldives\\r\\n\\r\\nA year into the job I was promoted to head of English. I am now head of year and sit on the governing body too. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t realise how rare it was for a woman of colour to hold a leadership position in a UK school and Iâ\\x80\\x99m proud to be part of the change. I would love other young people to continue taking up the mantle, to see that those roles are within their reach. Even if you are the only person who looks like you, going for jobs you deserve will enrich the diversity in classrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s love of writing and instil that passion in the children I teach. I established a partnership with Manchesterâ\\x80\\x99s Portico library that gives our pupils the chance to have a book review or short story published each year. A couple of years ago, I travelled to South Africa to establish links with a school in Cape Town. Now the children write to one another and share details about their lives. Writing unlocks the world for young people; it brings a subject or a place to life and allows them to express their own views and experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is so much I love about teaching â\\x80\\x93 the children, the joy they get as they progress. Playing a part in that is so rewarding, it gives me real purpose. This is a profession where hard work pays off. Our school is creative, we try to give the children ownership, chances to lead their learning, guiding them to discover answers for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are pupils going through hard times who allow me to connect with them too. The children inspire me as much as I hope I inspire them. I have worked hard but come far. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a job where I know that my best is enough. My parents had their own dreams but the sacrifices they made are my driving force and I am forever grateful to them for that. I feel that this path, this profession, makes their sacrifices worthwhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nRihula Sameer-Mour, 30, is head of English and of year 4 at Beaver Road Primary School, in Didsbury, Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn teaching every day is different, and so is every teacher.

She was recognised last year, in the further education lecturer of the year category, for her commitment to changing the lives of her students. â\\x80\\x9cI was just speechless when I was told,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cIt was overwhelming.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ICT teacherâ\\x80\\x99s journey to the front of the classroom has been anything but straightforward. Sharif Ali grew up on what she describes as â\\x80\\x9cthe worst estate in north Londonâ\\x80\\x9d and she would skip school to look after her four younger siblings or to help her mum.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI learned how to work the system,â\\x80\\x9d she says about turning up just enough not to raise alarm bells, or intercepting the post before it arrived at home. â\\x80\\x9cMy mind wasnâ\\x80\\x99t always on education. I learned to annoy teachers so that I would get kicked out of class and could go home. I was argumentative and sarcastic, and they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t handle me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can spot those tricks in my students now because Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been through it,â\\x80\\x9d she adds. â\\x80\\x9cWhen a student sits in front of me when they come to enrol at the college, especially the ones whoâ\\x80\\x99ve been through something similar or been kicked out of school, I always picture myself. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re trying to paint a picture, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve rehearsed lines. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re saying what they think I want to hear. I can always tell.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest â\\x80\\x98Education isnâ\\x80\\x99t always about whatâ\\x80\\x99s in a textbook. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about having a teacher who believes in youâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only her ICT teacher, she says, who took the time to try to understand and to encourage her. â\\x80\\x9cHe said: â\\x80\\x98Well done, that was amazing!â\\x80\\x99 about something I did one day. I never missed any of his classes after that. That was the one GCSE I got.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning home after spending a year living in Yemen with her grandparents, she started a part-time job at an opticianâ\\x80\\x99s and tried to enrol in further education. With few qualifications, she struggled to find somewhere that would accept her until she visited City of Westminster College, a further education college in central London. â\\x80\\x9cI told the tutor a bit about myself and she gave me a chance, enrolling me on to a BTec level 2 course in ICT.â\\x80\\x9d After progressing on to level 3 and graduating with distinctions and merits, she went to university to study complementary medicine (rather than her beloved ICT, as her family did not approve of it).\\r\\n\\r\\nTraining to become a teacher hadnâ\\x80\\x99t crossed her mind, and she was considering qualifying as an optometrist until a chance encounter on a train. â\\x80\\x9cI helped an elderly lady send a text message to her son. She was so grateful that I thought I might enjoy teaching older adults about technology.â\\x80\\x9d Later she researched routes into teaching and came across the diploma in education and training. It was during a placement at Newham College in east London, as part of the course, that she fell in love with working with teenagers.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could see part of me in many of the students. Newham was part of the Rise Project [which aims to empower young people to realise their potential], so there was an intake of students every week â\\x80\\x93 kids that have come into the country as refugees, kids speaking English as a second language, kids that have been kicked out of school.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce sheâ\\x80\\x99d graduated, she was offered a job at City of Westminster College, where sheâ\\x80\\x99d done her BTec courses years earlier. But she admits she was â\\x80\\x9cterrifiedâ\\x80\\x9d going into her first classroom. â\\x80\\x9cI got really thrown in at the deep end. [My boss] said: â\\x80\\x98These are the students weâ\\x80\\x99d consider challenging and reluctant learners.â\\x80\\x99 I will never forget my first tutor groups. They could have eaten me alive.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Misk Sharif Ali with her Pearson award\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of those first students, when interviewed by Pearson for the recent awards, described Sharif Ali as â\\x80\\x9cempowering, positive and encouragingâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cvery uniqueâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cone of the best teachers Iâ\\x80\\x98ve ever hadâ\\x80\\x9d. â\\x80\\x9cShe never gives up,â\\x80\\x9d one said. â\\x80\\x9cThat makes me look up to her. She believes in me.â\\x80\\x9d She helped a student with issues he was having organising a flat with the council, another who was struggling with their mental health, and stayed at college late to help with assignments, even if they were set by other teachers. Some students said they were about to give up, but she encouraged them to keep fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGiving them time is really important,â\\x80\\x9d Sharif Ali says about her approach in the classroom. â\\x80\\x9cI try to bring laughter, warmth, enjoyment to every class so my students donâ\\x80\\x99t feel they are in a lesson. I want them to feel like theyâ\\x80\\x99re safe, and to steer them towards making a positive change through my own failures and accomplishments.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving finished her diploma in education and training in 2015, she went on to complete her qualified teacher learning and skills certification three years later, and has almost completed a masterâ\\x80\\x99s in education.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI probably should have gone into teaching a long time ago,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cWhile sometimes it feels like a job that never finishes, you never really switch off, and it can be very, very challenging â\\x80\\x93 I always look forward to going to work.

       " 'Emmanuel Awoyelu: â\\x80\\x98As a young, black man who never had a black male primary teacher, I appreciate that representation mattersâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I think about my school experience, there are few positives I can take from it. By the time I left secondary school, I had already experienced two exclusions. Consequently, I left with only four A-C GCSEs and very little idea of what I would do with my life. As the eldest of three children, the weight I felt on my shoulders to succeed was immense. And the feeling of disappointment was even greater. My parents, who immigrated from Nigeria in the 80s, were incensed at how I was wasting my golden ticket to a better life. For them, education was vital because back home it was a luxury their families couldnâ\\x80\\x99t afford.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had many difficulties in school; I struggled to engage in particular lessons and often felt a lack of motivation. Admittedly, I was a class clown, and almost definitely used my humour and buffoonery at the wrong time on one too many occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one shining light was Ms Sponge. She was my English teacher for much of secondary school and very quickly became my â\\x80\\x9cschool motherâ\\x80\\x9d. It was a running joke that I was the teacherâ\\x80\\x99s pet; a title I earned not because I was a goody two-shoes â\\x80\\x93 quite the opposite. I was cheeky, humorous, and sometimes loud, but Ms Sponge never made me feel in the wrong. Instead, she helped me discover a love of writing. By calling me up to read in front of the class or asking me to share my stories, she created an arena for me to excel and did what no other teacher was capable of â\\x80\\x93 seeing beyond my defence mechanism of being a class clown and bringing out the best in me. In her class, I read and wrote stories and acted in plays that were far removed from my reality. Soon, I began to relish English lessons, knowing every writing task was an opportunity for escapism.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest â\\x80\\x98When I prepare my resources, I often incorporate my own stories, poems and song lyrics, and then get up in front of my year 6 pupils and perform as if I was headlining the Royal Albert Hallâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nMy love for the written word hit new heights when I started writing my own poetry. This developed into songwriting, which very quickly became my favourite way to express myself. Before long, I started performing songs in school assemblies, which gave me the confidence to perform at music events when I left school. Writing, in all its forms, was my passion and something I had a natural talent for â\\x80\\x93 but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure Iâ\\x80\\x99d have ever discovered it were it not for Ms Sponge. She cultivated my skills and saw me for who I was; an empty vessel waiting to be used to bless others.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite her impact on me, I never dreamed of becoming a teacher myself. Even when I eventually found myself working in education after university, I was initially content with the impact I was making as a teaching assistant and a sports coach. However, the more I worked with disadvantaged children, the greater my desire to make the leap became. I wanted to change the narrative for young boys who came from similar backgrounds to mine, I wanted to be the role model I needed growing up â\\x80\\x93 and I soon realised that becoming a fully fledged teacher was the best way to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, I knew what a good teacher could do for a childâ\\x80\\x99s confidence and development; Ms Spongeâ\\x80\\x99s kindness and love for teaching planted a seed in this young boy from East Ham. Despite the odds stacked against me as an excluded child, I went back to university to qualify as a teacher and now use my love of writing as a way to engage my students. I teach children who have social, emotional and mental health issues (SEMH) and most of them have had some type of adverse childhood experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I prepare my resources, I often incorporate my own stories, poems and song lyrics, and then get up in front of my year 6 pupils and perform as if I was headlining the Royal Albert Hall. Itâ\\x80\\x99s important for them to see me read so they, as young boys, learn to love the written word too. But I believe itâ\\x80\\x99s also important for them to hear about my cultural experiences: what it was like growing up in a Nigerian household or being a teenager in east London.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98As a Black teacher, I see racism damaging pupilsâ\\x80\\x99 potentialâ\\x80\\x99: why representation in the classroom matters Read more\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a young, black man who never had a black male primary teacher, I appreciate that representation matters. Some students can relate to my experiences; for others I provide a new perspective. Ultimately, sharing my authentic self is what makes me unique, and I encourage my students to do the same. I also urge them to read aloud to others, because their voice and experiences deserve to be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are ready and waiting to absorb knowledge, as long as you give them the chance to take the lead in their learning. This is why I love being a teacher, particularly to primary school children; to play a part in shaping the lives of the next generation is a privilege, and something I never take for granted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an educator in an SEMH school, you donâ\\x80\\x99t hear many â\\x80\\x9cthank yousâ\\x80\\x9d on a day-to-day basis, but the seed you sow in your students canâ\\x80\\x99t be underestimated.

       " 'Sophie Pender was the first in her family to go to university and believed what her mother had always told her â\\x80\\x93 in a meritocracy you can use education to rise above your family circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Pender, this was perhaps more important than for most students leaving home for university. Her childhood had been deeply affected by her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s addiction to drugs and alcohol. â\\x80\\x9cWe lived on a council estate in Borehamwood and had very little money. My mum did her best. But Dad was violent, and things had become so bad there were panic buttons in the house connected to the police station to protect us should he try to visit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Pender, now 24, was in her second year of secondary school her father died from substance abuse. She decided to throw herself into her schoolwork: â\\x80\\x9cEducation was something that I felt I could control and was a way of alleviating my circumstances. By working hard at school I could achieve anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt her school, only about 30% of her year achieved a C grade or above at GCSE. Nevertheless, she managed to attain three A* grades at A-level, the first person in her school to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemembering how inspired she was, Pender says: â\\x80\\x9cI wanted to go to Bristol University, and I wanted to be a lawyer, and it was all going to be great.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA boy told my friend that his tweed jacket was worth more than her house Sophie Pender\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at university she was in for a nasty shock. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I got to Bristol I thought not having a dad and growing up on a council estate wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t matter because after all I had these grades. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think people would care about my background.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead she found that to her peers, her background and her class mattered more than her academic achievements. Private school students mocked her accent and for the first time she encountered â\\x80\\x9cchav partiesâ\\x80\\x9d, where undergraduates dressed up in clothes that parodied their perception of working-class people.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI remember going to a flat where we were having drinks and a boy told my friend that his tweed jacket was worth more than her house. When I heard a girl talking about her â\\x80\\x98allowanceâ\\x80\\x99 for going on holiday I asked how much it was. But she just shut me down and said people didnâ\\x80\\x99t discuss family money. At my school we didnâ\\x80\\x99t discuss it because none of us had any money. These were new social rules that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand. I started to feel ashamed of my background. Very quickly my dream of my exciting new life at university was turning into a nightmare.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly 7% of pupils in the UK attend a private school but at Bristol University, they make up nearly a third of the graduate intake. Most of the so-called elite universities have disproportionately high numbers of private school students, including Oxford and Cambridge, which respectively have 31% and 32% representation from independent schools. At Bristol in 2016, the year Pender began her English degree, the proportion was closer to 40%.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter those early damaging encounters with privately educated students Pender decided to make a stand. â\\x80\\x9cI wanted to even things out a bit, so that those who didnâ\\x80\\x99t come from privileged backgrounds could help each other get on in life. And I didnâ\\x80\\x99t see why people from working-class families should feel ashamed of their upbringing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was the establishment of the first 93% Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nPender describes the club as a kind of old boysâ\\x80\\x99 network in reverse: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s artificially creating a movement against the idea that a small number of people get all the good jobs. Itâ\\x80\\x99s bringing people together who simply donâ\\x80\\x99t have those connections. The question of â\\x80\\x98what school did you go to?â\\x80\\x99, which private school people are always asking each other, is being replaced with â\\x80\\x98which 93% Club are you a member of?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the pandemic the movement has snowballed, from just two clubs at the start of 2020 to 36 participating universities today and a reach of more than 10,000 students. In December the club attained charitable status and has now attracted a plethora of high-profile corporate sponsors, including Accenture, CapitalOne, Herbert Smith Freehills, Newton Europe, DLA Piper, Teach First, OC&C Consulting and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinley Wright, the 93%â\\x80\\x99s marketing director, says the club is still growing, adding a new university nearly every week. â\\x80\\x9cI think before Covid-19, lots of students regarded their job prospects as pretty bleak. But when they were sent home and denied a campus education they realised just how big the gap was between themselves and the more privileged students they had met. Zoom tutorials also brought home to them how different their family homes were from wealthy studentsâ\\x80\\x99. Some find it so shaming they turn off their video cameras so people canâ\\x80\\x99t make judgments about their homes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapid spread of the club has met some hostility. There has been a rash of abusive messages on social media, and online networking events have been disrupted by gatecrashers. An event arranged by Edinburgh Universityâ\\x80\\x99s 93% Club in September was almost abandoned, say members, when anonymous zoomers started heckling the organisers and hurling obscene abuse at the invited speakers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Bristol in 2016, the year Sophie Pender began her degree, the proportion of private school pupils was close to 40%. Photograph: Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nMore moderate voices accuse the clubs of being divisive, even elitist themselves. One private school student posted a message asking them to imagine the uproar if he decided to set up a 7% club.\\r\\n\\r\\nPender dismisses this as public school sophistry: â\\x80\\x9cWhat they forget,â\\x80\\x9d she says, â\\x80\\x9cis that every university already has its own 7% club where membership is determined by how much money parents spent on their childâ\\x80\\x99s education. They donâ\\x80\\x99t need to set up a 7% club because they already benefit from privileged networks. The difference is our club is transparent â\\x80\\x93 out in the open for all to see.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she points out there are already elitist societies run for the benefit of very privileged students. The most famous is Oxford Universityâ\\x80\\x99s Bullingdon club, whose membership is exclusively public school and whose principal purpose is the riotous celebration of class war.\\r\\n\\r\\nWright says there is nothing to stop an Etonian who genuinely wants to appreciate how the other half are educated contacting the 93% Club: â\\x80\\x9cBut we are really catering for those who havenâ\\x80\\x99t been so fortunate to benefit from such a privileged start in education. We are not about denying others opportunity, what we want to do is even things up a bit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of state school students feel that they have had to seize the moment because universities have not done enough to advance social mobility through more progressive admissions systems. Long-term progress has been glacial, although in the past two years a number of wider-access initiatives at Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol have started to close the gap between private and state-educated entrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the numbers are not all heading in the right direction. At Durham University, admissions from fee-paying schools have risen for the third successive year to 37.8%. And when universities take account of the growing number of overseas students, who are predominantly privately educated, the overall figures do not look good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Bristol, students believe only radical measures will even up the numbers. On 2 March, the student union proposed a motion to cap private school graduate admissions at 7%, following criticism of the university for its low levels of social inclusivity. Other student unions are expected to hold their own votes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPender has now been taken on as a trainee solicitor by the City law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.

       " 'Instead of parking spaces, itâ\\x80\\x99s flowerbeds and vegetable planters that line the car-free street of Solar Avenue in Leeds, where rows of 60 low-energy homes form a little oasis along a bend in the River Aire, a short walk from the city centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilt in a factory across the road, these terrace houses are made from super-airtight timber panels stuffed full of wood-fibre insulation, with triple-glazed windows and solar panels on the roof, each erected in less than a week. Using up to 10 times less energy than a conventional house, their heating demand is so low that they create excess electricity that is fed into a community grid and used to charge shared electric cars. There will soon be 1,000 such homes here, along with a combined primary school and care home, as well as a timber office building with yoga decks and a tennis court on the roof, together forming the pioneering Climate Innovation District.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few years ago these houses would have been experimental one-offs. But a green-design campaign group has calculated there are as many as 30,000 low-carbon homes in the pipeline, an impressive turnaround in which the industry is leading the way, ahead of government regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Solar Avenue development backs on to the River Aire. Photograph: Citu\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe way we build housing in the UK hasnâ\\x80\\x99t changed much since the Victorian era,â\\x80\\x9d says Chris Thompson, the founder of Citu, the developer behind the Leeds project, which plans to build 500 low-energy homes a year. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all driven by perceived risk. Anyone looking to build something has to answer to a funder, whoâ\\x80\\x99ll use valuers to ensure that what youâ\\x80\\x99re proposing has a market.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShifting the mindset of such a risk-averse industry can seem like an insurmountable challenge, not helped by the government dragging its heels on policy changes. But now, after scrapping Labourâ\\x80\\x99s zero-carbon homes target in 2015, the Conservative government has finally developed a future homes standard, which will mandate all new homes to be â\\x80\\x9czero-carbon-readyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 although not until 2025 at the earliest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it has been the landlords with a long-term interest in the wellbeing of their tenants, and the longevity of their building stock, who are forging ahead with low-energy housing. Exeter city council, for example, has been quietly building zero-carbon homes for the last decade, with more than 200 council houses built so far to the exacting Passivhaus low-energy standard, and 1,000 more in the pipeline.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeter council has built homes so energy efficient that some residents have never used their central heating. Photograph: Apex\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe were originally driven by trying to address fuel poverty,â\\x80\\x9d says Emma Osmundsen, director of the councilâ\\x80\\x99s housing company, Exeter City Living. â\\x80\\x9cNot many people were talking about climate change in 2009, when we built our first three Passivhaus homes, so we became a kind of accidental pioneer.â\\x80\\x9d The council is now on the seventh generation of its low-energy house design, which it has honed over the years to make it as â\\x80\\x9cidiot-proofâ\\x80\\x9d as possible, says Osmundsen. Rather than timber frame, they use clay blocks that slot together like Lego bricks and contain a honeycomb of air pockets, negating the need for additional insulation. The homes are so thermally efficient that 60% of the tenants havenâ\\x80\\x99t had to switch on their heating at all â\\x80\\x93 some for more than 12 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many in the industry, she thinks the biggest barrier to wider adoption of low-energy standards is the lack of care and attention to detail on British building sites. â\\x80\\x9cPassivhaus is really not complicated, and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have to cost more than conventional construction,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a bit like baking a cake: most of the ingredients are the same as a regular house, but you just have to follow the recipe in the right order. Perhaps itâ\\x80\\x99s because the building industry is so male-dominated, but there is a general reluctance to follow the recipe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMany other councils are following Exeterâ\\x80\\x99s lead. Norwich completed the countryâ\\x80\\x99s largest Passivhaus social housing scheme in 2019, winning the prestigious RIBA Stirling Prize in the process, while York is planning an even more ambitious scheme by the same architects, Mikhail Riches. Cardiff University built an â\\x80\\x9cenergy positiveâ\\x80\\x9d solar house in 2015, using low-cost, off-the-peg materials, with features that have since been replicated in more than 1,400 affordable and low-carbon houses across Wales. Oxford has started work on its first zero-carbon council homes, while Enfield councilâ\\x80\\x99s huge Â£6bn Meridian Water development is also targeting net zero.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolcer house, Cardiff Universityâ\\x80\\x99s pioneering low-cost, low-energy house\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt used to feel like we were ploughing a lone furrow,â\\x80\\x9d says Jon Bootland, the chief executive of the Passivhaus Trust, which was established over a decade ago to promote the low-energy standard, but for years was seen as the preserve of one-off eco-homes in the countryside. â\\x80\\x9cNow our approach is really in the mainstream, as one of the few proven routes to net zero.â\\x80\\x9d The non-profit organisation, which trains designers and contractors and certifies buildings, has recorded a 60% increase in membership over the last year alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe environmental engineer Clara Bagenal George, the founder of the London Energy Transformation Initiative (Leti), has calculated that there are now about 30,000 homes at the masterplan stage that meet the Passivhaus target for a space heating demand of just 15 kWh/sq metre/year (compared with the current average of 54 kWh/sq metre/year), equating to a massive reduction in carbon. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an amazing story,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cThe industry defined â\\x80\\x98goodâ\\x80\\x99, over and above the regulations, and within a year there are now tens of thousands of homes in the works that meet this standard. It shows we can do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even the volume housebuilders are starting to get onboard. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s almost paradigm shift territory,â\\x80\\x9d says Simon Usher, divisional director of Persimmon Homes, one of the largest developers in the country, which infamously paid its former chief executive a Â£75m bonus in 2018, while its homes were found to be riddled with construction defects. In 2019 the company admitted it had lobbied the government to axe its zero-carbon policy, but, in an effort to clean up its image, with a new chief executive at the helm, it is now working on a prototype zero-carbon house of its own near its headquarters in York.\\r\\n\\r\\nA CGI of the new zero-carbon home that Persimmon is developing\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an unashamedly normal house,â\\x80\\x9d says Usher. â\\x80\\x9cWe wanted to see how far we could get with our standard masonry construction, building with our usual concrete bricks and tiles, but adding more insulation, beefing up the windows a bit, and adding an air-source heat pump in the garden. In the end, we got to zero carbon, for about 15% additional cost.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople are willing to pay more for an electric car to do the right thing,â\\x80\\x9d says Usher. â\\x80\\x9cWill they be willing to do the same for a zero-carbon home? The market will decide.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'British people are mostly onboard with kitchen recycling, but weâ\\x80\\x99re less diligent in the bathroom, where, depressingly, about half our packaging gets chucked straight into the bin to end its days in landfill. Today, there are myriad more eco-responsible shampoos, conditioners, bath and shower gels â\\x80\\x93 from luxury brands such as Aveda, Biolage and Davines to supermarket favourites such as Elvive and Garnier. The problem is that consumers, confused about labelling and correct recycling practices, panic-dispose.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is why I applaud top hairdresser George Northwood for launching his Undone haircare products in aluminium canisters. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an ideal material for the bathroom because, as well as being infinitely recyclable, aluminium is instantly identifiable as such: its opaque, silvery appearance sets it apart from the mishmash of bad, better and best plastics in the shower. (We instinctively know what to do with a baked bean tin, for example, so never dither.) Northwoodâ\\x80\\x99s lightweight containers look great, but crucially, the product inside is something Iâ\\x80\\x99ll use enthusiastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndirty shampoo and conditioner (Â£12 each for 250ml, georgenorthwood.com), for everyday use on finer hair types (there are versions for dry or damaged hair, too), leave hair properly clean and bouncy, silken and smelling extraordinary. Not since Sam McKnightâ\\x80\\x99s styling sprays has a new haircare brand passed so convincingly as expensive artisanal perfume.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince weâ\\x80\\x99re all pumping our way through handwash by the gallon, I was delighted to discover Kankan, which sells its range of botanical hand, baby and body washes in fizzy drink-style cans. Starter gift kits of an empty glass pump bottle, natural sponge and delicious-smelling gel refill cost Â£24, but since the world doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need more pumps (the spring mechanism and tube of which arenâ\\x80\\x99t easily divisible), Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been topping up my empties with the refill bundle (Â£40).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re a soaker not a sprayer, you, too, can turn to aluminium. Molton Brownâ\\x80\\x99s luxurious Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel Bath Salts (Â£22, 300g) come in gift-worthy aluminium packaging. Meanwhile, the excellent Au Lait range (a personal favourite) from the Scottish Fine Soaps Company includes a delicious, skin-softening milk bath powder (Â£14.99 for a whopping 500g, scottishfinesoaps.com), packaged in a cute aluminium milk churn-style tin that can be recycled or reused as flour storage.',\n",
       " 'When the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced his budget on Wednesday, he talked about the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s goal of turning generation rent into â\\x80\\x9cgeneration buyâ\\x80\\x9d. The measures he outlined to help would-be homebuyers had been heavily trailed â\\x80\\x93 an extension to the stamp duty holiday he launched last year for England and Northern Ireland, and a new UK scheme to bring back 95% mortgages. But the budget documents brought more detail. We have looked at the small print to see what the measures will mean for homebuyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow will the 95% mortgage scheme work?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to the virtual disappearance of mortgages that only require a 5% deposit â\\x80\\x93 there were only five 95% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage products available last month compared with 391 in March 2020, and those were specialist deals, according to the financial data provider Moneyfacts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initiative aims to encourage banks and building societies to offer 95% mortgages again. It will do this by giving them the chance to buy a guarantee on the portion of the mortgage between 80% and 95%. If a borrower gets into financial difficulty and their property is repossessed, the government will cover that chunk of the lenderâ\\x80\\x99s losses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scheme will open for new mortgage applications in April and run until the end of 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s largest lenders, including Lloyds, NatWest, Santander, Barclays and HSBC, will be offering these 95% mortgages from next month, with others including Virgin Money due to follow shortly after.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho will be eligible ?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 95% mortgage scheme will open for new applications in April and run until the end of 2022. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images\\r\\n\\r\\nThis scheme is for any â\\x80\\x9ccreditworthyâ\\x80\\x9d household struggling to save for a higher deposit. These will be standard residential mortgages â\\x80\\x93 so no second homes or buy-to-lets â\\x80\\x93 and the property has to cost Â£600,000 or less.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mortgages must be on a repayment basis, not interest-only. And borrowers will need to be credit checked and meet the standard rules on affordability.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat will the interest rates on these deals be like?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe donâ\\x80\\x99t know yet but experts are predicting they will come in at below 4%.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiles Robinson, the head of mortgages at the online mortgage broker Trussle, says: â\\x80\\x9cAt the moment, 90% LTV mortgage rates are 3% to 3.5%, so we could expect 95% LTV mortgage rates to be between 3.5% to 4%. However, thereâ\\x80\\x99s the potential that lenders will adjust 90% LTV rates as well as launching 95% LTV deals, so we could see slightly lower deals coming through.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNick Morrey, the product technical manager at the broker John Charcol, says: â\\x80\\x9cI would expect the 95% products to range from 3.49% to 3.99%, with some going over, depending on length â\\x80\\x93 for example, five-year fixed rates without a product fee.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the scheme, the government has told lenders they must offer a five-year fixed-rate deal so borrowers can lock their repayments at a set level for the medium term.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is happening with stamp duty?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temporary stamp duty holiday is being extended in England and Northern Ireland. Until 30 June, the first Â£500,000 spent on a property will be tax-free, which means a saving of up to Â£15,000. After that, the threshold will drop to Â£250,000 until 30 September. It will then return to its normal level of Â£125,000. However, first-time buyers have a separate threshold, set at Â£300,000, and that will come back into play after June.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first cut will have an impact on first-time buyers who are spending more than Â£300,000, and all other homebuyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an existing homeowner planning to pay Â£450,000 for their new home, moving in before the end of June will mean a saving of Â£12,500 over the standard cost. If they complete in July, they will pay Â£10,000 â\\x80\\x93 a saving of Â£2,500. It is still worth having but probably not enough incentive to try to start a new purchase to complete before the end of September.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a mover, buying a home for Â£250,000, there is no duty now but also no need to rush to complete before the end of June. Completing by the end of September will mean a Â£2,500 saving.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Wales, the holiday is on the value up to Â£250,000, and that has also been extended until the end of June. In Scotland, the temporary threshold of Â£250,000 will end on 31 March.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould I try to buy now to beat the change?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temporary stamp duty holiday is being extended in England and Northern Ireland. Photograph: csimagebase/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless you are a cash buyer, itâ\\x80\\x99s unlikely that you can find somewhere now and complete before the June deadline â\\x80\\x93 those pushing for the extension were arguing it was needed because of the big backlog of purchases in the system.\\r\\n\\r\\nRay Harriot, the CEO and founder of Reliable Property Group, which helps buyers with conveyancing, surveys and mortgages, says when the backlog is combined with â\\x80\\x9cthe UKâ\\x80\\x99s fairly archaic homebuying system â\\x80¦ June suddenly doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look that far awayâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says buyers should â\\x80\\x9cnow focus on their own timeline and avoid being fast-tracked into deals by overeager sellers on a deadline, as this pressure may force them to cut cornersâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill the changes help buyers?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the measures will help some people on to the housing ladder, Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at BuiltPlace, says the packet of measures â\\x80\\x9cis clearly about supporting the market rather than a group of individualsâ\\x80\\x9d. He points to the fact that the holiday has been stepped down, rather than the government opting just to extend it for people who are already in the system and may have just missed out. â\\x80\\x9cAlso, it continues to apply to investors and second home buyers, while at the same time they are talking about helping generation rent.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHudson says the 95% mortgage guarantee will offer lenders confidence to reintroduce those deals but not many buyers will benefit. â\\x80\\x9cA 95% mortgage is no help in London and other expensive parts of the country because you bump up against the affordability tests. It will really be most help in the Midlands and the north.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd supporting the market means that prices are unlikely to fall â\\x80\\x93 in the short-term at least. â\\x80\\x9cAll of this is pointing to a continued strong housing market for the rest of the year â\\x80\\x93 but there is a lot of risk out there: people are still on furlough or losing their jobs,â\\x80\\x9d he says. If you are struggling to keep up with rising prices, the new measures could make matters worse rather than better.\\r\\n\\r\\nCase study: â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a massive weight off our shouldersâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nBess Browning and her partner, Bobby Dolan, were delighted to hear Rishi Sunak confirm that he was extending the stamp duty holiday until the end of June.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s absolutely fantastic for us â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s just a massive weight off our shoulders,â\\x80\\x9d says Browning, 29. She and her partner are in the final stages of buying a two-bedroom terrace house, and paying no stamp duty means a saving of Â£11,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe couple sped up their search for a new home because of the stamp duty incentive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99re right at the end of the process â\\x80\\x93 our mortgage offer has been released and the solicitors have done everything Bess Browning\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found a property they liked in Faversham in Kent, and had their Â£370,000 offer accepted last October. At the time of the offer, they were told the transaction would take approximately 16 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrowning works as a journalist on womenâ\\x80\\x99s magazines, while Dolan, 30, is a secondary school teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first property that the couple â\\x80\\x93 who are currently renting â\\x80\\x93 have bought together. Browning already owns a flat in Faversham that she rents out.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re actually getting worried,â\\x80\\x9d Browning said a few days before the announcement. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re right at the end of the process â\\x80\\x93 our mortgage offer has been released and the solicitors have done everything they need to do. [But] everything just seems to be taking a lot longer â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s quite frustrating.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not sure what they would do if they ended up facing an unexpected stamp duty bill. â\\x80\\x9cEleven grand is so much money â\\x80¦ We would have to borrow it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chancellorâ\\x80\\x99s move should give them time to do all of the paperwork they need to for the purchase. Announcing the extension, Sunak said: â\\x80\\x9cDue to the sheer volume of transactions weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing, many new purchases wonâ\\x80\\x99t complete in time for the end of March.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking after they got the news that they have three more months to complete and still benefit from the tax break, Browning says: â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re towards the end but weâ\\x80\\x99re still not there yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had seen all the speculation in the days running up to the budget regarding a possible extension but did not want to assume that it was a done deal. â\\x80\\x9cNow we donâ\\x80\\x99t have to worry,â\\x80\\x9d she says.',\n",

Cooksonâ\\x80\\x99s was a landscape of collieries, shipyards, rumbling coal trains, sooty-faced kids and the instantly nostalgic tones of pithead silver bands playing Haydn. While fragments of her world remain â\\x80\\x93 mainly in the doughty cheerfulness of the locals â\\x80\\x93 over the past four decades, as heavy industry has receded, a more distant past has emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwelve centuries before Dame Catherine began her career, the north-eastâ\\x80\\x99s first great literary figure, the Venerable Bede, was busy writing the histories that would help forge an English identity. Saint Bede (whose story is brought to life at the excellent Jarrow Hall Anglo-Saxon Village) divided his time between the twin monasteries of Saint Paulâ\\x80\\x99s in Jarrow and Saint Peterâ\\x80\\x99s in Monkwearmouth. Today, these Anglo-Saxon sites are connected by Bedeâ\\x80\\x99s Way, a 12-mile trail that winds through the countryside between the metropolitan sprawls of Jarrow and South Shields to the north, and Sunderland to the south. Flanked by wide, sandy beaches and jagged cliffs, this is an area of undulating pastures, deciduous woodlands, water vole-populated streams and villages with roots going back to the days of the Historia Ecclesiastica.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them, Cleadon, has a Victorian water tower more than 30 metres high that can be seen for miles around (a landmark so widely visible the Luftwaffe used it for navigation during the second world war).

Whitburn beach sweeps south towards Seaburn, forming part of what locals call the Roker Riviera.

This was the first electric lighthouse in the world (it celebrates its 150th anniversary this year) and is also home to a cartoonishly gigantic foghorn. Below the lighthouse, waves thrash against savage rocks. Among the hundreds of ships that foundered here were two galleons from the Spanish Armada.

I glance up at Billinge Lump as I exit St Helens: at 179 metres, itâ\\x80\\x99s the highest point on the West Lancashire plain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main road goes all the way to Southport, but I prefer the B-roads via Burscough, which take me across the Leeds & Liverpool Canal. The Old Packet House, on the canal side, is OK for a lager top and a meal. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ve packed a sandwich and prefer to take a wander along the towpath: thereâ\\x80\\x99s a six-mile there-and-back walk north along the Rufford branch of the waterway, taking in the National Trustâ\\x80\\x99s Tudor Rufford Old Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in the saddle, a little way out of Burscough, I come to Martin Mere, the marshy remnant of an 18-mile-wide lake drained in the 1690s and 1770s and now run by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a famous haven for birds: pink-footed geese and whooper swans migrate here in winter, and common spring sightings include redshanks and peewits. Yes, I know, weâ\\x80\\x99ve veered into Lancashire, but almost all of Merseyside and a bit of Cheshire used to be inside the Red Rose County.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wildfowl on Martin Mere wetland nature reserve. Photograph: John Keates/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area Iâ\\x80\\x99m pedalling across is known as the Mosses or Mosslands, though only 3% of the original lowland raised peat bogs remain. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a precious habitat for large heath butterfly, nightjar, bog bush-cricket and sundew, and projects are afoot to link up the extant patches. The area is completely flat, which makes cycling painless and glorious. I can look around, enjoy the open space and breathe easily. The land is quite green: frequent, sometimes heavy rain means thereâ\\x80\\x99s more livestock and dairy farming than arable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI use back roads all the way to Banks, just north of Southport, with only a short ride on the A565 and a more pleasant cycle along a residential street named Ralphâ\\x80\\x99s Wifeâ\\x80\\x99s Lane. I arrive at the coast close to RSPB-run Marshside, an area of coastal grassland and salt marshes, and another bird sanctuary. I ride sunnily on to Marine Drive (the western end of the Trans-Pennine NCN62) and turn south into Southport. Here the nostalgia waves increase, which is just as well as there are no real ones: the sea is, as usual, out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthport is the natural stopover for a two-day trip. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sticking around, though, but taking Sustrans Route 810 down to Liverpool. Itâ\\x80\\x99s 19Â½ miles and almost 60% of the route is traffic-free, through a mix of beaches and sand dunes, footballersâ\\x80\\x99 mansions and a red squirrel reserve. Cycling is great, but some sections of the Sefton Coastal Path â\\x80\\x93 which it joins â\\x80\\x93 are for pedestrians only.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I leave Formby beach behind, I enter what I think of as Merseyside, or Scouseland, proper. Born five miles outside Liverpool, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a â\\x80\\x9cwoolâ\\x80\\x9d, or â\\x80\\x9cwoollybackâ\\x80\\x9d, and you might think Iâ\\x80\\x99d naturally prefer fields and collieries. But I secretly envy Liverpudliansâ\\x80\\x99 heritage, and as I ride into the grubby outskirts itâ\\x80\\x99s not Antony Gormleyâ\\x80\\x99s statues at Crosby that excite me so much as whatâ\\x80\\x99s left of the docks and warehouses. Ports are such evocative places, and Liverpool was once defined by its outward, maritime face.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bar at the Bold Hotel, Southport\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I park at Lime Street station, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen the best of Merseyside. The county is usually presented as either grimly urban or industrial, and if the surrounding countryside is mentioned at all, itâ\\x80\\x99s as if it has a Jekyll-and-Hyde relationship with the city. But the canal and roads, coast and conurbations link and intersect these milieus. The marshes kept the north-west a sort of badlands through the medieval era and beyond; now they are green spaces from which to take in broad horizons and big skies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere to stay The Bold Hotel off Southportâ\\x80\\x99s Lord Street is great for a drink and has doubles from around Â£75.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere to eat Fishcakes and line-caught haddock at award-winning Fylde Fish Bar in Marshside are perfect.

Photograph: Hugh Mothersole\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time ago (well, October 2020), in a galaxy far, far away (OK, in Buckinghamshire), a field in the village of Bourne End was transformed into an alien planet. Acres of green grass were converted into crimson-red sand, and a facade of small terracotta buildings was built to form an otherworldly high street. Hollywood had discovered this place and earmarked it as a set for the latest Stars Wars film. Almost overnight, this usually sleepy village was filled with actors, film crews and special-effects teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not the first time that Bourne End has seen a dramatic transformation. Sitting on the Thames, between Marlow and Cookham, at the mouth of the River Wye (the name means end of the river), it has for many years been shaped by the flow of water. Mills used to line its banks; today, the current drives leisure seekers here â\\x80\\x93 kayakers, wild swimmers and birdwatchers â\\x80\\x93 often by happy accident rather than design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was how I discovered its charms, as I wandered the Thames Path during lockdown 1. It was a hot and humid afternoon, and so inviting were the many sandy spits of land edging the footpath that I waded in to cool my feet. Later, I returned with a paddleboard, admiring the riverside houses and watching common terns dive for food while I drifted by.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon Bourne End became a regular swimming spot for me, often just before sunset. I would do widths of the Thames while great crested grebes, mallards and swans watched me, red kites swirled overhead and the light dappled tangerine through the branches of weeping willows.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other (Berkshire) side of the river is a pub, The Bounty, which has no road access (itâ\\x80\\x99s reached by a footbridge from Bourne End or, for a donation in their charity box, a boat ride over). I would often front crawl over for a swift beer and packet of crisps before heading home, dripping wet and smiling, feeling smug for finding such a special place.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Summer wildflowers at Winter Hill, just across the river from Bourne End. Photograph: Ian Wilson/National Trust\\r\\n\\r\\nA short walk from the pubâ\\x80\\x99s beer garden is Winter Hill, a high terrace of grassland thought to have been colonised by stone age hunter-gatherers as long ago as 350,000BC. Since then, bronze age tumuli have been found, and remnants of Roman pottery dug from its lower flanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recent human visitors have cleaved boot-beaten tracks into its chalk slopes, and this winter, when the whole area was under a blanket of snow and the river was too cold and fast flowing to swim in, I climbed to its top to watch the sun set over two counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps my favourite find is on the Buckinghamshire side of the Thames, west of the village, where probably the biggest transformation has taken place. Until 2001 this was a sprawling gravel pit, source of stone to build the nearby motorways. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s unrecognisable, having been converted into the Spade Oak nature reserve, home to an abundance of birds. On my many walks around the former quarry â\\x80\\x93 now a pretty lake â\\x80\\x93 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve spied kingfishers, cormorants and herons. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard warblers call, watched swallows swoop for insects and lapwings wheel against the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite all its natural riches, Bourne End has managed to escape any air of pretension sometimes felt in other riverside communities. On every visit Iâ\\x80\\x99ve struck up conversations with friendly locals in, on or alongside the water. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why, for me, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t need the arrival of A-listers to confirm its star quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The self-contained Riverside Boathouse sleeps four\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere to stay The Riverside Boathouse is a self-contained studio sleeping four right on the riverbank, from Â£127 a night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere to eat Try The Spade Oak, a stoneâ\\x80\\x99s throw from the nature reserve, after a walking or birdwatching trip.

Photograph: Bryan Eveleigh/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nYou canâ\\x80\\x99t miss Thaxted, nor should you. The stupendous spire of its parish church is like an arrow, visible from miles around, above the waves of undulating farmland. Thaxted is clearly more than a village and, unlikely as it now seems, it rivalled Sheffield as capital of the cutlery trade in the 14th and 15th centuries. Nobody has an explanation, but presumably the iron came from redundant weapons and the skilled workmen from somewhere else.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guild of Cutlers built themselves an intricate, oak-framed Guildhall, but the scale and beauty of the church (the Shell Guide rates it â\\x80\\x9cbest church in Essexâ\\x80\\x9d) points to sustained wealth, cutlery giving way to wool. Reached up a little pebbled track, the church is (informally at least) part of a picturesque group including two rows of single-storey cottages built as almshouses. One row, with fretwork bargeboards like a Swiss chalet, is now a single cottage; the other is three tiny houses. Behind them stands John Webbâ\\x80\\x99s handsome windmill.\\r\\n\\r\\nI first got to know Thaxted when visiting a friend and colleague who lived just below the church in a confusing old house whose every room seemed to be on a different level. James (Jim) Boutwood was a historic buildings architect, one of a team on Essex county council that investigated and mended a breathtaking set of monastic grain barns at Cressing Temple, near Witham.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost summers we would meet and go church-crawling: south to Tilty, with its half-hidden clues to the 13th-century abbey that once stood there; to Stebbing, where the spectacular rood-screen is, improbably, of stone rather than painted and carved wood. Once, further east, we tracked down a memorial column standing, inexplicably, in a field at Colne Engaine. It was designed by John Soane, whose biography I was then writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThaxted is home to a summer music festival, which was started by Gustav Holst in 1916. He, like HG Wells, was a tenant of generous, even profligate, Daisy, Countess of Warwick. The mistress of the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII, she ran through two fortunes, her own and then her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s, to become a free-spending radical, setting up the first state secondary school in Essex and offering a 30-year living to the Reverend Conrad Noel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morris dancing in Thaxted. Photograph: Philippe Hays/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nHe signalled his politics by displaying the Red Flag alongside those of Saint George and Sinn FÃ©in in Thaxted church and tolled the bells on Empire Day to mark the nationâ\\x80\\x99s sacrifices to imperialism. For all that righteous anger, he also set up an annual Thaxted morris dancing event in 1911 that still continues (though not in Covid times).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf folk dancing isnâ\\x80\\x99t for you, there are few better ways of passing a summer evening than settling down for a couple of hours in that great, generous church, light pouring in through the clear glass as some choral masterwork washes over you.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaisy Warwick lived on at Easton Lodge, which was much reduced by a disastrous fire. She offered what was left of it to the new Labour party, and then the TUC, but both refused. The barn was converted to a theatre, and the church has a memorial to Ellen Terry, as well as the grandiose tombs of earlier generations of Daisyâ\\x80\\x99s family. A charitable trust now runs the Gardens of Easton Lodge â\\x80\\x93 known for snowdrops in early spring â\\x80\\x93 and volunteers are reinstating Harold Petoâ\\x80\\x99s Italianate water gardens, having rebuilt an Edwardian treehouse and brought the walled kitchen garden back into productive use. An ambitious annual country show in the village (cancelled last year) perpetuates yet another of Daisyâ\\x80\\x99s initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are well-marked footpaths everywhere. One from Thaxted to Tilty, for example, follows a stream, grandly named the upper Chelmer, which once powered the abbeyâ\\x80\\x99s watermill. A circular walk from Great Bardfield, a few miles east of Thaxted, to Finchingfield is also good, with pubs and food â\\x80\\x93 the Bell and the Fox respectively â\\x80\\x93 at both ends and even a tiny new independent bookshop, Between the Lines, in Great Bardfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Swan Hotel, Thaxted\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village became famous from the 1930s as an informal artistic colony centred on Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden. Their work, and that of their circle, is shown in regular exhibitions at the Fry Gallery in Saffron Walden. Coming for a weekend? Surely youâ\\x80\\x99ll need a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere to stay The Swan Hotel in Thaxted (doubles from Â£55 room-only) is a 20-room former coaching inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere to eat At the Flitch of Bacon in Little Dunmow, eight miles south of Thaxted, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily find much bacon on the menu (to Jay Raynerâ\\x80\\x99s disappointment â\\x80\\x93 though he thought the food excellent).

Photograph: Bill Allsopp/Alamy\\r\\n\\r\\nReal ale and gentle countryside probably spring to mind when you picture the smallest county in England. Peaceful landscapes are definitely one of the compelling charms of Rutland â\\x80\\x93 there are no madding crowds here. The countyâ\\x80\\x99s centrepiece is Rutland Water, a horseshoe-shaped reservoir that is the second-largest expanse of water in England, built in the 1970s to store water for the growing population of the east Midlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nRinged by an 18-mile cycle track (23 miles if the central Hambleton spit is included), it has cafes, cycling shops and even a bug zoo scattered along its north and south shores. At the Rutland Water Fishing Lodge, guides can be hired for trout fishing, but more noteworthy is the â\\x80\\x9cpredator fishingâ\\x80\\x9d with a flotilla of little white boats hunting around the coves for zander and huge pike. Sailing, canoeing, paddleboarding, wild swimming and windsurfing are all also catered for, and for youngsters thereâ\\x80\\x99s an aquapark with an inflatable obstacle course.\\r\\n\\r\\nEgleton nature reserve, which occupies the western end of Rutland Water, is a string of shallow lagoons with abundant birdlife â\\x80\\x93 more than 20,000 birds have a regular home on the reservoir, and wigeon, gadwall, cormorant, great crested grebe, coot, lapwing, mallard and tufted duck are the most common waterfowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove them on platforms nest ospreys; in 2001 they were the first to breed in England for 150 years. They now fly in every spring from Africa and raise their young on the plentiful fish in the reservoir. This is the UKâ\\x80\\x99s number one location for osprey watching. Anglian Water charges for entry (Â£6/Â£3), so itâ\\x80\\x99s worth making it a full day out to experience the whole reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Buttercross in the market town of Oakham.

Oakham, just west of Rutland Water, has no fewer than 15 cafes, many clustered around the Butter Market Cross, a stoneâ\\x80\\x99s throw from the 800-year-old Oakham Castle, one of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s best-preserved Norman buildings. Tradition has it that passing noblemen must leave a tribute of a horseshoe at the hall, and the walls are bedecked with giant ceremonial gilded examples, some more than 500 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakham is also home to Rutland Bitter â\\x80\\x93 a distinctive beer with its own little appellation contrÃ´lÃ©e that is only brewed at the Grainstore Brewery, which also offers tours.

I was also struck â\\x80\\x93 but not surprised â\\x80\\x93 by the then-16-year-old girl saying that she was ashamed to tell anyone about her sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understood her shame.

When we were in fifth grade, a teacher told us about an 11-year-old Italian girl whose male neighbour attempted to rape her. It was unclear what the word rape meant, only that it was obviously sinful for everyone involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe virtuous child begged her would-be rapist to kill her instead so that she would remain pure. This meant she could go straight to heaven instead of hell, the teacher said. He stabbed her to death, and now St Maria has the dubious honour of being the churchâ\\x80\\x99s youngest virgin martyr.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe the student was also given the cautionary tale about a teenage couple who participated in the act of fornication â\\x80\\x93 another word I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know. Driving home from wherever this disgusting encounter took place, they had a horrific car accident. The girl was killed in a particularly gory manner, described to us in a level of detail I havenâ\\x80\\x99t forgotten over two decades later.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the punchline was when police arrived on the scene and the boy sobbed: â\\x80\\x9cI drove her to her death, but I flung her into hell.â\\x80\\x9d This was because she didnâ\\x80\\x99t have time to repent for fornicating, our teacher explained matter-of-factly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the same age as young St Maria Goretti when I heard these â\\x80\\x9ctrueâ\\x80\\x9d stories in class. With my murky understanding of sex and rape, the two became indistinguishable: both were mortal sins with eternal damnation as a punishment. Consent was inconsequential â\\x80\\x93 and never mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs pre-teens, we were each given a prayer card with the image of this little girl saint, so that we could beg her for the same strength to choose death over impurity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time we reached high school, our sex education consisted entirely of bullying us into being terrified of losing our virginity. We were lectured on how the pill would give us cancer and told that the only proven form of contraception was abstinence. â\\x80\\x9cJust say no!â\\x80\\x9d If our no was ignored? It meant we werenâ\\x80\\x99t saying it clearly enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe watched videos called Sex Has a Price Tag and Sex Still Has a Price Tag. In them, we saw American evangelist Pam Stenzel travel around schools to scream at teenage audiences that girls who have sex with more than one man are like sticky tape who lose their stick.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if the sexual assault survivor from my school was shown these videos too â\\x80\\x93 if, like me, she learned from a young age that her intrinsic worth as a woman and a human being was no greater than her purity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the absence of actual contact with boys, we learned plenty about them through a baffling array of euphemisms: men were like dogs, and if you put the food in front of them they had to eat it; they were wild stallions and women bravely held the reins; they were cars and if you revved up their engines but left them stuck in neutral, then they would explode. It was up to women, always women, to keep their foot firmly on the brakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, menâ\\x80\\x99s brains were smaller than womenâ\\x80\\x99s so they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be held responsible. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why they always did stupid things without thinking, like going abseiling with no harnesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sexually assaulting teenage girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we didnâ\\x80\\x99t know any men, we were already burdened with the task of controlling their thoughts and actions. My first failure occurred at the age of 13, when I received a Saturday detention for â\\x80\\x9cflirting with a camp instructorâ\\x80\\x9d (a 30-year-old man) because I was wearing shorts above my knees and sitting with my legs slightly apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal brought me into her office â\\x80\\x93 one of many similar visits â\\x80\\x93 and raged â\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s the fidelity?â\\x80\\x9d I had already been unfaithful to my future husband by showing another man my adolescent knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing my infidelity, our outdoor camps were quickly replaced by prayer retreats so there wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be any exposure to male instructors. But there were still priests â\\x80\\x93 and we were made to cover our shoulders and forearms so they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t catch sight of our bare flesh. â\\x80\\x9cA priest is still a man,â\\x80\\x9d we were regularly reminded.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 16, our bodies were becoming problems that needed to be managed, as they filled out in the places most likely to tempt men\\r\\n\\r\\nOne student even had a jumper forcibly placed on her before the teacher would take her to hospital after she fell and broke her collarbone. The girlâ\\x80\\x99s pain was secondary to the imagined horror of a doctor having impure thoughts while performing his job.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpure thoughts are also a sin,â\\x80\\x9d we were told. And we understood that a manâ\\x80\\x99s thought was our sin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 16, our bodies were becoming problems that needed to be managed, as they filled out in the places most likely to tempt men.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur teachers, many of whom belonged to this religious sect and were lifelong celibates, surveilled and policed how we walked and talked and dressed. We had etiquette classes to teach us the correct way to sit and stand and to show us how to wear a white blouse without the outline of our bra being visible. It was the teachersâ\\x80\\x99 job to make sure we never let our guard down for a moment in case we lured men into sin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s what rape was. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a crime, a violation, or an abuse of power. There was only sin, for which women were not just equally guilty, they were to blame.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen years after my 2001 graduation from the private girlsâ\\x80\\x99 school I got very drunk with a male friend I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seen for a while. I woke up the next morning to find him in my bed, along with scant memories of him on top of me the night before, in between blackouts. Heâ\\x80\\x99d bought us four bottles of wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought the feeling of violation would be the worst part. But then came the shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was deeply ashamed of this encounter because shame was burned into my sexual identity and sense of self-worth while I was still in the fragile process of forming them. I had been told I was bad so many times throughout my childhood and adolescence that I truly believed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike every girl in our school, I knew full well that if you so much as touched alcohol, you were asking for it\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ashamed because, like every girl in our school, I knew full well that if you so much as touched alcohol, you were asking for it. â\\x80\\x9cJust say no!â\\x80\\x9d didnâ\\x80\\x99t work if you were incapable of saying anything at all; then youâ\\x80\\x99d brought it on yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ashamed because if you put yourself alone and intoxicated in a room with a man, then it was only natural that he would have expectations. You canâ\\x80\\x99t give the dog the bone and then snatch it away, they told us at school.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I was ashamed because I forgot for one evening to hold tight to the stallionâ\\x80\\x99s reins exactly the way I was trained to. There was no question in my mind whose fault it was. He was supposed to be my friend â\\x80\\x93 but I was the one whoâ\\x80\\x99d led him on.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was 32 when this happened, not 16. But all those years in between were not enough to undo the damage inflicted by my private school education. We didnâ\\x80\\x99t learn about alcohol and consent, because we didnâ\\x80\\x99t learn about consent at all. I never heard the word uttered once in 13 years â\\x80\\x93 and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure the boys at our brother school didnâ\\x80\\x99t either.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that same private school in Sydneyâ\\x80\\x99s suburbs, and others like it, testimonial after testimonial after testimonial makes it clear that little girls are still learning they are to blame for their sexual assaults. I wonder how many others donâ\\x80\\x99t even realise that what happened to them wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a â\\x80\\x9csinâ\\x80\\x9d or a â\\x80\\x9cpoor choiceâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd without proper consent education for both boys and girls, I fear for another generation of young women who will have to live with shame their entire lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

       " 'This is the way the world ends: in a candy store. When I asked Kim Dotcom for his address in Queenstown so I could sit with him a while and interview him about his views on how to survive the coming apocalypse, he replied that he would send someone to collect me on a Thursday at 4pm at the Remarkables Sweet Shop on the main street in nearby Arrowtown. I got there early. It was a cold, fresh winterâ\\x80\\x99s day, with black ice and low snow, and birds shivered in the trees above the pretty Arrow River. Tourists filled the candy store. I stood there lurking among the trays of Aniseed Twists and Cola Fizzballs. As soon as I stepped onto the pavement, a big black Mercedes pulled up. It was four oâ\\x80\\x99clock on the dot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rendezvous had come about because Dotcom got in touch after reading a story I wrote for The New Zealand Herald about preparing for Doomsday. â\\x80\\x9cThe end of the world as we know it is coming,â\\x80\\x9d he emailed. â\\x80\\x9cWe are close, I think.â\\x80\\x9d I thought so, too. I wrote a year-long series of stories about end days; the subject occupied my mind day and night, I was sleepless, worried, a wreck, but I fancied that I was also practical and methodical, and kept busy by laying down provisions and supplies to protect my family when the world spiralled towards Hell in a fiery and terrifying hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe particular story that Dotcom had read was based on a far- sighted study commissioned by the government in 1987. It looked at ways New Zealand would â\\x80\\x93 and wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x93 survive a nuclear war. He asked for a copy. I got a PDF made of the 342-page report and sent it his way in exchange for an interview. And so to the rendezvous in a sweet shop, where I took the opportunity to lay down a few more provisions for Doomsday â\\x80\\x93 who wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be grateful to suck on a tin of Pac-Man Ghost Sours as eternal night closes in?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drive to Chez Dotcom took about 10 minutes. It was at the end of a long, straight road on a tussock flat. The mountains of Coronet Peak loomed to the north, the mountains of the Remarkables loomed to the south. There was a lot of looming going on, and there was more to come as we drew up to the house on a small rise: Kim Dotcom suddenly appeared, vast, mountainous, loomsome.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was immediately apparent that there was even more of him than the last time we met. That was in 2016, in an Auckland court, during his extradition hearing. A special leather chair was brought into the courtroom to support Dotcomâ\\x80\\x99s bulk during the weeks that his legal team argued against the full, awesome might of the law agencies of the United States of America, which sought to ship Dotcom to American soil so he can rot in an American jail. Dotcom, as the former head of Megaupload, was accused of copyright infringement, racketeering, money laundering and fraud. He waited over two years for the Court of Appeal to decide his fate. Like a raven of doom, I flew into Queenstown on the very morning that the appeal court finally made its ruling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSorry,â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever feel sorry,â\\x80\\x9d Anthony Hopkinsâ\\x80\\x99s millionaire character says in that great movie The Edge, â\\x80\\x9cfor a man who owns a plane.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDotcomâ\\x80\\x99s wealth was beyond anything I could even imagine. The FBI had seized something in the region of $60 million in its worldwide raid of his businesses. He was still able to operate in superb luxury. But when I met him in Queenstown, I saw him as a tragic figure, marooned and under constant threat of imprisonment, and felt ashamed that Iâ\\x80\\x99d routinely seen him for so long as merely a ridiculous figure.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I always felt the case against Dotcom was a shocking disgrace and a black mark on New Zealand constitutional law, that we were the willing dupes of the US law enforcement military complex, that the US law enforcement military complex was itself the willing dupe of Washington via Hollywood and the income it lost to Dotcomâ\\x80\\x99s home entertainment site which allowed users to watch movies for free; and that all of it conspired to deprive Dotcom of his basic human rights. This was the guy whose house was invaded by gun-toting goons, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake. A black-ops Special Tactics Group burst in on his Coatesville mansion at dawn and hauled Dotcomâ\\x80\\x99s ass to jail. Heâ\\x80\\x99d been spied on, raided, royally shafted.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually, though, I found it hard to care. By the time of his extradition hearing it felt like Dotcom had worked hard and very successfully to make himself look silly. He repelled widespread sympathy and support when he financed a weird, terrible political party, and staged the infamous Moment of Truth rally at the Auckland Town Hall during the 2014 election campaign. He promised it would reveal [then prime minister John] Key as a crook. It didnâ\\x80\\x99t. The only thing I can remember from that night was an appearance made by Julian Assange via Skype at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London â\\x80\\x93 not because of anything Assange said, but because just as he began his monologue a cleaner from the embassy arrived and did the vacuuming behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was around about then that Dotcom was lumped with just about the worst term of abuse that a visitor to New Zealand can suffer: overstayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an edited extract from Missing Persons: Twelve extraordinary tales of Death and Disappearance in New Zealand, by Steve Braunias (HarperCollins NZ, NZ$35)',\n",
       " 'The mysterious deaths of nine Russian hikers in Dyatlov Pass in 1959 has spawned many outlandish theories and a bad horror movie. Some of the victims had traumatic injuries. New research suggests these may have been caused by a slab avalanche that battered rather than just burying them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis theory does not account for why some victims died of hypothermia having fled almost naked from the campsite after the avalanche. However, an effect known as paradoxical undressing is well known in cold weather medicine and may occur in up to half of deaths associated with hypothermia. Snowbound victims remove coats, sweaters and even trousers before dying from the cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the body cools, vasoconstriction occurs, meaning that blood vessels narrow to divert blood away from the periphery of the body and maintain temperature at the core. This causes a loss of mental clarity sometimes known as â\\x80\\x9ccold stupidâ\\x80\\x9d. When vasoconstriction falls off, the victim senses their skin becoming warmer. Feeling strangely hot, in their confusion they take off layers of clothing, usually becoming unconscious soon afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scene of the deaths at Dyatlov Pass was certainly puzzling, as the bodies were only discovered long after the event. But the answer more likely lies with established if unusual natural phenomena rather than with the paranormal.',\n",
       " 'Joining TikTok has become something of a trend for Hollywood celebrities stuck at home like everyone else. So it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily surprising to see Tom Cruise on the app, sharing videos of himself playing golf and pratfalling around the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the strange thing is that Cruise never actually made the videos. And the account that posted them, DeepTomCruise, wore that on its sleeve: it was openly the work of a talented creator of â\\x80\\x9cdeepfakesâ\\x80\\x9d, AI-generated video clips that use a variety of techniques to create situations that have never happened in the real world.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being open about its falseness, the accountâ\\x80\\x99s videos are so realistic that they still prompted wild speculation. Commercial tools for recognising deepfakes cleared the clips as â\\x80\\x9cauthenticâ\\x80\\x9d, and while eagle-eyed viewers claimed to spot artefacts, such as an out-of-sync reflection, others pondered whether the fake was itself fake: maybe Tom Cruise really had joined TikTok, in a meta hoax?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of DeepTomCruiseâ\\x80\\x99s videos.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the creator of the account has come forward to talk about his work. Or creators, rather, because DeepTomCruise is the product of a collaboration between the Belgian visual effects artist Christopher Ume and the Tom Cruise impersonator Miles Fisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two had worked together once before, when Ume had put Cruiseâ\\x80\\x99s face on Fisher for a web series the latter was making imagining the actorâ\\x80\\x99s campaign for the 2020 presidency. But the mysterious TikTok account wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the result of a deep plan, Ume says. â\\x80\\x9cA month later, he contacted me again, and said: â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s make a funny video â\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99ll film myself in my garden and then you just make me look like Tom Cruise.â\\x80\\x99 And so we did that and he posted it â\\x80\\x93 but he also created a TikTok account. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about the app, I donâ\\x80\\x99t either, but then then two days later, he sends me a screenshot: â\\x80\\x98Dude. Two and a half million views.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUme is no stranger to viral success. Despite only hearing about the concept of a deepfake in late 2018, he quickly decided to try his hand at creating them, and soon became one of the most adept users of the technology. In 2020, South Park Studios hired him to combine deepfake tech with the work of a team of crack comic writers, and last October, his first professional creation was uploaded: Sassy Justice, a Peter Serafinowicz-starring sketch in which the lead character interviews a host of global icons, all played by Serafinowicz.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the DeepTomCruise account is a step further still. And Ume cautions it will not be the last time a nearly flawless deepfake appears unannounced. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d like to show people the technical possibilities of these things. I donâ\\x80\\x99t intend to use it in any way where I would upset people â\\x80\\x93 I just want to show them whatâ\\x80\\x99s possible in a few years.â\\x80\\x9d What now takes an inventive impersonator, a beefy computer, and a skilled practitioner days of work could be done by a simple Snapchat filter by 2025, he suggests. â\\x80\\x9cI just strongly think that there should be laws to help with the responsible use of AI and deepfakes,â\\x80\\x9d Ume says.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Ume, though, there is one other major hope he has for this whole affair: a single shot at the job of a lifetime. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I started doing video and working on my projects, just in general, I always had a dream. I would like to work for Peter Jackson on The Lord of the Rings. Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying this in every interview: hey, Peter, if youâ\\x80\\x99re reading this, contact me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether or not the New Zealand director takes Ume up on his offer, at least one person in Hollywood appears to have learned something from his and Fisherâ\\x80\\x99s stunt: while Tom Cruise has refused to comment on the videos, the actor now has a verified account on TikTok â\\x80\\x93 although with zero videos posted, and just 20,000 fans, he is apparently less popular than his deepfake counterpart.',\n",
       " 'In late 2019, as Joe Biden stood on a debate stage and boldly vowed to make Saudi Arabia a pariah if he was elected president, a little-known former aide and Middle East expert was examining what exactly a â\\x80\\x9cprogressiveâ\\x80\\x9d post-Trump stance towards the oil-rich kingdom might look like.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Benaim, a policy wonk who had worked for Biden as a speechwriter, and for Hillary Clinton and John Kerry before that, first travelled to Saudi Arabia and then began interviewing dozens of Democratic and progressive policy experts to come up with a blueprint.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe experts â\\x80\\x93 former US diplomats, political appointees, academics and activists â\\x80\\x93 were divided on a single question: was the US relationship with Saudi Arabia and its young and obviously rash, murderous and unstable de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, worth salvaging?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor so-called â\\x80\\x9crethinkersâ\\x80\\x9d, as Benaim called them, the answer was no, the partnership with Saudi Arabia was unreliable, unpalatable, outdated and overrated. The â\\x80\\x9cresettersâ\\x80\\x9d, on the other hand, believed there was enduring value in the relationship but that it needed some â\\x80\\x9ctough loveâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Biden administration prepared last week to release a long-awaited report on the murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, dissidents, activists and some members of Congress hoped the new US president would deliver a response true to his â\\x80\\x9cpariahâ\\x80\\x9d campaign promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome rethinkers believed intense pressure from Riyadhâ\\x80\\x99s most important ally â\\x80\\x93 targeted directly at the man whom intelligence agencies concluded was complicit in the killing â\\x80\\x93 might even lead to Prince Mohammedâ\\x80\\x99s removal from the royal line of succession.\\r\\n\\r\\nJamal Khashoggi. Photograph: Ali Haider/EPA\\r\\n\\r\\nBiden instead endorsed a policy of â\\x80\\x9crecalibrationâ\\x80\\x9d but â\\x80\\x9cnot ruptureâ\\x80\\x9d, the precise words Benaim â\\x80\\x93 now one of the state departmentâ\\x80\\x99s most senior Middle East advisers â\\x80\\x93 had used in his own analysis and policy recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Trump years, in which the former administration ignored grave human rights abuses, the White Houseâ\\x80\\x99s decision to release the report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on the Khashoggi murder was hailed for its transparency, as was Bidenâ\\x80\\x99s decision to personally shun Prince Mohammed and call for an end to the kingdomâ\\x80\\x99s war in Yemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the move to forego targeted sanctions against the prince was also met with dismay in many circles, including in the halls of Congress where distaste for the crown prince is one of few issues on which Democrats and Republicans can find common ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Washington Post editorial acknowledged that Biden was at least ending Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cgrotesque and unprecedented coddlingâ\\x80\\x9d of Saudi Arabia, but said he was â\\x80\\x9cnevertheless granting what amounts to a pass to a ruler who has sown instability around the Middle East in recent years while presiding over the most severe repression of dissent in modern Saudi historyâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Trump with Mohammed bin Salman in 2019. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\\r\\n\\r\\nNed Price, the state department spokesperson, defended the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s actions. â\\x80\\x9cThis administration sent a frank message to Saudi leaders,â\\x80\\x9d he said at a press conference early this week. â\\x80\\x9cWe seek a partnership that reflects our important work together and our shared interests and priorities, but also one conducted with greater transparency, responsibility and accord with Americaâ\\x80\\x99s values.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said the US would not â\\x80\\x9cignore or minimise egregious misconductâ\\x80\\x9d, but the relationship was nevertheless important to US interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeniamâ\\x80\\x99s June 2020 report for the Century Foundation, which appears to have influenced decision making, offered additional clues about the issues that may have guided the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s thinking, including the enduring importance of oil and counter-terrorism cooperation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeniam noted that some experts believed it was dangerous to underrate the importance of Saudi internal stability, and that the â\\x80\\x9cconsequences of Prince Mohammedâ\\x80\\x99s downfall for the United States could be worse than the Iranian Revolution of 1979â\\x80\\x9d. Despite their differences, Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s relationship with Riyadh also stood in sharp contrast to that with Tehran and its â\\x80\\x9cfoundational anti-Americanismâ\\x80\\x9d, others said.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnnamed officials describing the Biden administrationâ\\x80\\x99s internal deliberations to the Washington Post said a public ban against the grandson of the founder of Saudi Arabia was seen as akin to declaring a hostile relationship with the kingdom, the protector of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s holiest Muslim sites. Freezing Prince Mohammedâ\\x80\\x99s assets, another idea critics floated, was seen as virtually impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of Congress have nevertheless expressed frustration. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think this story is over, by far,â\\x80\\x9d said Bruce Riedel, a former longtime CIA analyst on Saudi Arabia and one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s pre-eminent experts on the kingdomâ\\x80\\x99s royal family. â\\x80\\x9cWhat I can say with confidence is that the controversy is far from over, it will continue in the public domain, in the media, and on the Hill. The administration is going to have a tough time convincing people that this was enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislative proposals are already in the works in Congress to target Prince Mohammed. Robert Menendez, the Democratic chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, has raised the possibility of sanctioning the crown prince through the global Magnitsky Act, which targets officials for violating human rights, and said it was important that he faced â\\x80\\x9creal consequencesâ\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Congress did decide to take action against the prince without Bidenâ\\x80\\x99s explicit support, it would not be the first time lawmakers have outmanoeuvred a president on a Saudi-related issue. At the end of the Obama administration, Congress overrode a presidential veto and passed a law that limited Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s sovereign immunity from lawsuits brought by the families of victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiedel noted that Prince Mohammed was under intense pressure at home, leading a costly war that Saudi Arabia was losing in Yemen and facing threats from domestic enemies after alienating members of the royal family, including those â\\x80\\x9che shook downâ\\x80\\x9d as part of a so-called anti-corruption crackdown at the Ritz-Carlton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aftermath of a Saudi-led coalition airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen, in 2016. Photograph: Osamah Abdulrhman/AP\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked whether it was now effectively too late to believe that the prince could be stopped from becoming king, he said: â\\x80\\x9cNo. He has a lot of enemies in Saudi Arabia. If the objective of the United States is a stable, moderate Saudi Arabia that is stable internally and not a source of unrest in the region, then that Saudi Arabia has no place for Mohammed bin Salman. We know that, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen years of it now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRiedel and others have also pointed to contradictions in the White Houseâ\\x80\\x99s policy that will become difficult to navigate. It has said Biden will only deal with his counterpart King Salman, but his son could in theory become king at any moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the White House sought to defend its decision to stop short of sanctioning the prince directly, it pointed to historical precedence in that foreign heads of state were not usually subjected to such measures.

I just feel we are often not looking at that relationship with honest eyes,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to decide right now is next steps. The actions MBS took two years ago pushed our relationship to this brink. It is MBS who has endangered our relationship and therefore he has the responsibility to take the actions to try to repair them. What is he going to do, what is he going to bring to the table?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Kim and other lawmakers, the issue is not just about winning justice for Khashoggi, but also envisioning what the US relationship looks like after a future â\\x80\\x9cKing MBSâ\\x80\\x9d has been in charge for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn alliance isnâ\\x80\\x99t just an alliance for its own sake, it tries to serve some type of strategic objective and purpose,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat view was echoed by Abdullah Alaoudh, a Saudi academic and activist based in Washington whose father, a high-profile pro-reform cleric, is facing the death penalty in a Saudi prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are people who say â\\x80\\x98letâ\\x80\\x99s be realistsâ\\x80\\x99.

       " 'There are only so many polite words that come to mind when one spots a ship apparently hovering above the ocean during a stroll along the English coastline.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Morris, who captured the extraordinary sight on camera, declared himself â\\x80\\x9cstunnedâ\\x80\\x9d when he noticed a giant tanker floating above the water as he looked out to sea from a hamlet near Falmouth in Cornwall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect is an example of an optical illusion known as a superior mirage. Such illusions are reasonably common in the Arctic but can also happen in UK winters when the atmospheric conditions are right, though they are very rare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe illusion is caused by a meteorological phenomenon called a temperature inversion. Normally, the air temperature drops with increasing altitude, making mountaintops colder than the foothills. But in a temperature inversion, warm air sits on top of a band of colder air, playing havoc with our visual perception. The inversion in Cornwall was caused by chilly air lying over the relatively cold sea with warmer air above.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause cold air is denser than warm air, it has a higher refractive index. In the case of the â\\x80\\x9chovering shipâ\\x80\\x9d, this means light rays coming from the ship are bent downwards as it passes through the colder air, to observers on the shoreline. This makes the ship appear in a higher position than it really is â\\x80\\x93 in this instance, above the sea surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuperior mirages occur because of the weather condition known as a temperature inversion, where cold air lies close to the sea with warmer air above it,â\\x80\\x9d said David Braine, a BBC meteorologist. â\\x80\\x9cSince cold air is denser than warm air, it bends light towards the eyes of someone standing on the ground or on the coast, changing how a distant object appears.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWeatherwatch: Castles in the air Read more\\r\\n\\r\\nHe added: â\\x80\\x9cSuperior mirages can produce a few different types of images â\\x80\\x93 here a distant ship appears to float high above its actual position, but sometimes an object below the horizon can become visible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotographers around the world have captured striking images of ships, yachts and other vessels apparently hovering in mid-air thanks to superior mirages. One potential clue that the sight is a mirage is the lack of any detail below the vesselâ\\x80\\x99s waterline â\\x80\\x93 for example a mirage of a â\\x80\\x9choveringâ\\x80\\x9d yacht lacked the lower hull and keel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter effect is well known to sailors who can sometimes rely on refraction to spot ships that are geometrically beyond the horizon. Sailors say such ships are â\\x80\\x9cloomingâ\\x80\\x9d over the horizon and sometimes report distortions that stretch or compress the images, making them â\\x80\\x9ctoweringâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cstoopingâ\\x80\\x9d mirages, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore familiar optical illusions are the â\\x80\\x9cinferior miragesâ\\x80\\x9d that give rise to apparent oases in the desert and puddles on hot summer roads. These mirages happen when cooler air sits on a layer of hot air, directly above a road, for example. When sunlight coming down from the sky approaches the air near the hot surface, it is bent back upwards to the observerâ\\x80\\x99s eye, making the sky appear to be reflected on the road.',\n",

Everywhere you go in the world, a photo ID is required [to vote]. Everywhere you go in the world, itâ\\x80\\x99s by vast majority in-person voting because thatâ\\x80\\x99s how you really can help maintain one-person-one-vote because the person actually appears before you.

Pritzker wanted Sen. Kimberly Lightford â\\x80\\x94 a big Pritzker supporter â\\x80\\x94 to become the upper chamberâ\\x80\\x99s chief, but his party gave the nod to Democrat Dan Harmon instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nPritzker also mistakenly thought he had another track to grow his influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, longtime House Speaker and Democrat Party chief Michael Madigan â\\x80\\x9cretiredâ\\x80\\x9d just ahead of a growing investigation into political corruption that had been edging ever closer to him. Madigan has had a chokehold on Illinois Demsocrats for more than four decades, and Pritzker saw his departure as a chance to take hold of the party for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, Pritzker made a play to get Chicago Ald. Michelle Harris to replace the recently resigned Madigan as party chief. Unfortunately for the governor, the party went in a different direction by handing the keys to the party to U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, who became the stateâ\\x80\\x99s first black female Democratic Party chairwoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nPritzker has come up dry in other areas, too. For instance, he lost his attempt to force Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle to follow his ideas on distributing the coronavirus vaccine in their jurisdictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPritzker dove into the influence game with gusto by donating ten million dollars of his own money to many of Madiganâ\\x80\\x99s allies. He also jumped to put one Madigan suggestion after another into positions of power, likely assuming he was buying himself some consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, though, all his money, favors, and positioning seem to have afforded him little favor among the Democrat establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.',\n",

       " 'Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that advisers to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) intervened with officials of the New York State Department of Health in July and caused them to underreport the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state at that time by at least 2,800, and possibly more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary purpose of this New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) report, as initially published July 6, 2020 using the significantly underreported COVID-19 nursing home death data, appears to have been to absolve Gov. Cuomo of responsibility for the dramatic increase in nursing home COVID-19 deaths that took place in the immediate aftermath of his March 25, 2020 order requiring nursing homes to accept COVID-19 positive residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA survey conducted by NYSDOH shows that approximately 6,326 COVID-positive residents were admitted to facilities between March 25, 2020 and May 8, 2020,â\\x80\\x9d the July 6, 2020 NYSDOH report stated:\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, an analysis of the timing of admissions versus fatalities shows that it could not be the driver of nursing home infections or fatalities. An individual nursing home-by-nursing home analysis of admissions versus fatalities further supports this finding. A causal link between the admission policy and infections/fatalities would be supported through a direct link in timing between the two, meaning that if admission of patients into nursing homes caused infectionâ\\x80\\x94and by extension mortalityâ\\x80\\x94 the time interval between the admission and mortality curves would be consistent with the expected interval between infection and death. However, the peak date COVID-positive residents entered nursing homes occurred on April 14, 2020, a week after peak mortality in New Yorkâ\\x80\\x99s nursing homes occurred on April 8, 2020. If admissions were driving fatalities, the order of the peak fatalities and peak admissions would have been reversed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Thursdayâ\\x80\\x99s reports in the Journal and the Times serve to undermine the credibility of that absolution for Cuomo, since the underlying data underreported COVID-19 nursing home deaths by at least 40 percent, if not more, during the March 25 to May 8, 2020 time period when COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to nursing homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCiting â\\x80\\x9cpeople with knowledge of the reportâ\\x80\\x99s production,â\\x80\\x9d the Journal reported the details in a story titled â\\x80\\x9cCuomo Advisers altered Report on COVID-19 Nursing Home Deaths: Changes resulted in a significant undercount of the death toll attributed to long-term-care facility residents.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomoâ\\x80\\x99s top advisers successfully pushed state health officials to strip a public report of data showing that more nursing-home residents had died of Covid-19 than the administration had acknowledged, according to people with knowledge of the reportâ\\x80\\x99s production. The July report, which examined the factors that led to the spread of the virus in nursing homes, focused only on residents who died inside long-term-care facilities, leaving out those who had died in hospitals after becoming sick in nursing homes. As a result, the report said 6,432 nursing-home residents had diedâ\\x80\\x94a significant undercount of the death toll attributed to the stateâ\\x80\\x99s most vulnerable population, the people said. The initial version of the report said nearly 10,000 nursing-home residents had died in New York by July last year, one of the people said. The changes Mr. Cuomoâ\\x80\\x99s aides and health officials made to the nursing-home report, which havenâ\\x80\\x99t been previously disclosed, reveal that the state possessed a fuller accounting of out-of-facility nursing-home deaths as early as the summer. The Health Department resisted calls by state and federal lawmakers, media outlets and others to release the data for another eight months. (emphasis added) The latest revelation in the expanding Cuomo nursing home scandal comes on the heels of a report last month from the Empire Center for Public Policy that â\\x80\\x9cundermines claims by the New York State Department of Health that Gov. Andrew Cuomoâ\\x80\\x99s (D-NY) controversial March 25 order requiring nursing homes in the state to admit coronavirus-positive residents had no impact on nursing home coronavirus death rates.â\\x80\\x9d In that report, titled, â\\x80\\x9cCOVID-positive Admissions Were Correlated with Higher Death Rates in New York Nursing Homes,â\\x80\\x9d the Albany, New York, based think tank concluded, â\\x80\\x9cThe admission of coronavirus-positive patients into New York nursing homes under March 25 guidance from the New York State Department of Health was associated with a statistically significant increase in resident deaths.â\\x80\\x9d Cuomoâ\\x80\\x99s controversial March 25, 2020, guidance was in effect until May 10, 2020. â\\x80\\x9cStatewide, the findings imply that COVID-positive new admissions between late March and early May, which numbered 6,327, were associated with several hundred and possibly more than 1,000 additional resident deaths,â\\x80\\x9d (emphasis added) the Empire Center study found . The conclusion of the Empire Center study stated: The data indicate that the March 25 memo was not the sole or primary cause of the heavy death toll in nursing homes, which stood at approximately 13,200 as of early this month [February 2021]. At the same time, the findings contradict a central conclusion of the Health Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s July 6 report on coronavirus in nursing homes, which said, among other things: â\\x80\\x9cAdmission policies were not a significant factor in nursing home fatalitiesâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cThe data do not show a consistent relationship between admissions and increased mortality.â\\x80\\x9d The Journal reported back in September that Cuomoâ\\x80\\x99s aides reviewed the July report: State health officials said in a July report that long-term-care facilities were already rife with infection by the March 25 nursing-home order, attributing the spread among patients to employees who brought the virus with them to work. Senior members of Mr. Cuomoâ\\x80\\x99s staff reviewed and edited the report before it was published, state officials said. The governorâ\\x80\\x99s team also withheld approval for the resumption of nursing-home visitations, people familiar with the matter said, and rejected a Health Department proposal for a regional approach to easing the ban. A Health Department spokesman said the agency had taken a thoughtful approach that involves â\\x80\\x9cmonitoring the data, reviewing reasonable requests and recognizing that this pandemic is not over.â\\x80\\x9d (emphasis added) The New York Times on Thursday offered a similar account to the Journal on the underreporting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths in the July 2020 New York State Department of Health Report, though it said the true number of COVID-19 nursing home deaths was 9,250, not the Journalâ\\x80\\x98s â\\x80\\x9cless than 10,000,â\\x80\\x9d as Breitbart News reported The New York Times details the coverup citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo (D) faced early criticism in his state for ordering nursing homes to take patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, as the elderly are among those most vulnerable to the virus. After reports surfaced in February that Cuomo was intentionally hiding the numbers, the governorâ\\x80\\x99s office explained he was withholding the truth to prevent then-President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration from using the data to launch a politically motivated attack. Cuomo blamed the â\\x80\\x9ctoxic political environmentâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cdisinformationâ\\x80\\x9d for the revised numbers. But the Times states Cuomo began hiding the truth about the numbers long before the Justice Department began their investigation in August. The June numbers showed the actual death toll in nursing homes was â\\x80\\x9croughly 50 percent higherâ\\x80\\x9d than the numbers ultimately cited by the Cuomo administration, according to the Times. The actual number of 9,250 nursing home deaths by June were much larger than the reported 6,432 nursing-home deaths â\\x80\\x94 more than a 40 percent increase.',\n",

Quote: â\\x80\\x98That gave us the opportunity to come.â\\x80\\x99 Another reporter put it this way: â\\x80\\x98The message received in Tijuana and other Mexican border cities was simple: Joe Biden was now letting people in.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80¦ Republicans just spent four years making major headway on the security and humanitarian crises on our border. It took serious policy changes. It took international diplomacy with multiple countries. It took border enforcement. The American people would be better served if the Biden Administration had chosen to build on this progress, instead of rapidly trying to tear it down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current inrush of legal migration was created by the 1990 immigration bill, which was jointly pushed by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and then-President George. H. W. Bush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill roughly doubled legal immigration, expanded the H-1B program to let the tech sector build its own non-American workforce, and supercharged Wall Street profits. The subsequent inflow also sucked jobs, investment, and wealth from heartland states â\\x80\\x94 including McConnellâ\\x80\\x99s Kentucky â\\x80\\x94 and inflated investment and wealth in the coastal states, such as Sen. Chuck Schumerâ\\x80\\x99s New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decades since 1990 have shown that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1990 bill passed 78 to 17, with yes votes from McConnell and nearly all GOP Senators.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, however, McConnell worked behind the scenes to block the â\\x80\\x9cGang of Eightâ\\x80\\x9d amnesty.',\n",
